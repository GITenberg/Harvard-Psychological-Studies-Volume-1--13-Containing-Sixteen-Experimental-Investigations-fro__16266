<h2><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii"></a><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The appearance of the HARVARD PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES
does not indicate an internal change in the work of the Harvard
Psychological Laboratory. But while up to this time the results
of our investigations have been scattered in various places, and
have often remained unpublished through lack of space, henceforth,
we hope to have in these STUDIES the opportunity to
publish the researches of the Harvard Laboratory more fully
and in one place. Only contributions from members of the
Harvard Psychological Laboratory will be printed in these
volumes, which will appear at irregular intervals, and the contributions
will represent only our experimental work; non-experimental
papers will form an exception, as with the present
volume, wherein only the last one of the sixteen papers belongs
to theoretical psychology.</p>

<p>This first volume does not give account of all sides of our
laboratory work. An essential part of the investigations every
year has been the study of the active processes, such as attention,
apperception, and volition. During the last year several
papers from these fields have been completed, but we were
unable to include them in this volume on account of the space
limits; they are kept back for the second volume, in which
accordingly the essays on the active functions will prevail, as
those on perception, memory, and feeling prevail in this volume.
It is thus clear that we aim to extend our experimental work
over the whole field of psychology and to avoid one-sideness.
Nevertheless there is no absence of unity in our work; it is not
scattered work as might appear at a first glance; for while the
choice of subjects is always made with relation to the special
interests of the students, there is after all one central interest
which unifies the work and has influenced the development of
the whole laboratory during the years of my direction.</p>

<p><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv"></a>I have always believed&mdash;a view I have fully discussed in my
'Grundz&uuml;ge der Psychologie'&mdash;that of the two great contending
theories of modern psychology, neither the association
theory nor the apperception theory is a satisfactory expression
of facts, and that a synthesis of both which combines the advantages
without the defects of either can be attained as soon
as a psychophysical theory is developed which shall consider
the central process in its dependence, not only upon the sensory,
but also upon the motor excitement. This I call the <i>action theory</i>.
In the service of this theory it is essential to study more fully
the r&ocirc;le of the centrifugal processes in mental life, and, although
perhaps no single paper of this first volume appears to offer a
direct discussion of this motor problem, it was my interest in
this most general question which controlled the selection of all
the particular problems.</p>

<p>This relation to the central problem of the r&ocirc;le of centrifugal
processes involves hardly any limitation as to the subject
matter; plenty of problems offer themselves in almost every
chapter of psychology, since no mental function is without relation
to the centrifugal actions. Yet, it is unavoidable that
certain groups of questions should predominate for a while.
This volume indicates, for instance, that the &aelig;sthetic processes
have attracted our attention in an especially high degree. But
even if we abstract from their important relation to the motor
functions, we have good reasons for turning to them, as the
&aelig;sthetic feelings are of all feeling processes decidedly those
which can be produced in the laboratory most purely; their disinterested
character makes them more satisfactory for experimental
study than any other feelings.</p>

<p>Another group of researches which predominates in our
laboratory is that on comparative psychology. Three rooms
of the laboratory are reserved for psychological experiments
on animals, under the special charge of Dr. Yerkes. The
work is strictly psychological, not vivisectional; and it is our
special purpose to bring animal psychology more in contact
with those methods which have found their development in the
laboratories for human psychology. The use of the reaction-time
<a name="Page_v" id="Page_v"></a>method for the study of the frog, as described in the
fifteenth paper, may stand as a typical illustration of our aim.</p>

<p>All the work of this volume has been done by well-trained
post-graduate students, and, above all, such advanced students
were not only the experimenters but also the only subjects. It
is the rule of the laboratory that everyone who carries on a
special research has to be a subject in several other investigations.
The reporting experimenters take the responsibility for
the theoretical views which they express. While I have proposed
the subjects and methods for all the investigations, and
while I can take the responsibility for the experiments which
were carried on under my daily supervision, I have left fullest
freedom to the authors in the expression of their views. My
own views and my own conclusions from the experiments would
not seldom be in contradiction with theirs, as the authors are
sometimes also in contradiction with one another; but while I,
of course, have taken part in frequent discussions during the
work, in the completed papers my r&ocirc;le has been merely that of
editor, and I have nowhere added further comments.</p>

<p>In this work of editing I am under great obligation to Dr.
Holt, the assistant of the laboratory, for his helpful co&ouml;peration.</p>

<h2><a name="PER1" id="PER1"></a>EYE-MOVEMENT AND CENTRAL AN&AElig;STHESIA.</h2>

<h4>BY EDWIN B. HOLT.</h4>

<h3>I. THE PROBLEM OF AN&AElig;STHESIA DURING EYE-MOVEMENT.</h3>

<p>A first suggestion of the possible presence of an&aelig;sthesia
during eye-movement is given by a very simple observation.
All near objects seen from a fairly rapidly moving car appear
fused. No further suggestion of their various contour is distinguishable
than blurred streaks of color arranged parallel, in a
hazy stream which flows rapidly past toward the rear of the
train. Whereas if the eye is kept constantly moving from object
to object scarcely a suggestion of this blurred appearance
can be detected. The phenomenon is striking, since, if the
eye moves in the same direction as the train, it is certain that
the images on the retina succeed one another even more rapidly
than when the eye is at rest. A supposition which occurs to
one at once as a possible explanation is that perchance during
eye-movement the retinal stimulations do not affect consciousness.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if one fixates a fly which happens to be
crawling across the window-pane and follows its movements
continuously, the objects outside swim past as confusedly as
ever, and the image of the fly remains always distinct. Here
the eye is moving, and it may be rapidly, yet both the fly and
the blurred landscape testify to a thorough awareness of the
retinal stimulations. There seems to be no an&aelig;sthesia here.
It may be, however, that the eye-movement which follows a
moving object is different from that which strikes out independently
across the visual field; and while in the former case
there is no an&aelig;sthesia, perhaps in the latter case there is
an&aelig;sthesia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[4]</span><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>Cattell,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_1_1'>1</a> in considering a similar experience, gives his opinion
that not the absence of fusion for the moving eye, but its
presence for the resting eye, needs explanation. &quot;More than
a thousand interruptions per second,&quot; he believes, &quot;give a
series of sharply defined retinal processes.&quot; But as for the
fusion of moving objects seen when the eyes are at rest, Cattell
says, &quot;It is not necessary and would probably be disadvantageous
for us to see the separate phases.&quot; Even where distinct
vision would be 'disadvantageous' he half doubts if fusion
comes to the rescue, or if even the color-wheel ever produces
complete fusion. &quot;I have never been able,&quot; he writes, &quot;to
make gray in a color-wheel from red and green (with the necessary
correction of blue), but when it is as nearly gray as it can
be got I see both red and green with an appearance of translucence.&quot;</p>

<p>That the retina can hold apart more than one thousand stimulations
per second, that there is, in fact, no such thing as
fusion, is a supposition which is in such striking contrast to all
previous explanations of optical phenomena, that it should be
accepted only if no other theory can do justice to them. It is
hoped that the following pages will show that the facts do not
demand such a theory.</p>

<p>Another simple observation is interesting in this connection.
If at any time, except when the eyes are quite fresh, one closes
one's eyes and attends to the after-images, some will be
found which are so faint as to be just barely distinguishable
from the idioretinal light. If the attention is then fixed on one
such after-image, and the eyes are moved, the image will suddenly
disappear and slowly emerge again after the eyes have
come to rest. This disappearance during eye-movements can
be observed also on after-images of considerable intensity;
these, however, flash back instantly into view, so that the
observation is somewhat more difficult. Exner,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_2_2'>2</a> in speaking of
this phenomenon, adds that in general &quot;subjective visual
phenomena whose origin lies in the retina, as for instance after-images,<span class="pagenum">[5]</span><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>
Purkinje's vessel-figure, or the phenomena of circulation
under discussion, are almost exclusively to be seen when
the eye is rigidly fixed on a certain spot: as soon as a movement
of the eye is made, the subjective phenomena disappear.&quot;</p>


<p>The facts here mentioned in no wise contradict a phenomenon
recently discussed by McDougall,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_3_3'>3</a> wherein eye-movements
revive sensations which had already faded. Thus an eye-movement
will bring back an after-image which was no longer
visible. This return to vividness takes place after the movement
has been completed, and there is no contention that the
image is seen just during the movement.</p>

<p>The disappearance of after-images during eye-movements is
mentioned by Fick and G&uuml;rber,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_4_4'>4</a> who seek to explain the phenomenon
by ascribing it to a momentary period of recovery which
the retina perhaps undergoes, and which would for the moment
prevent further stimulations from being transmitted to the optic
nerve. Exner observes that this explanation would not, however,
apply to the disappearance of the vessel-figure, the circulation
phenomenon, the foveal figure, the polarization-sheaf of
Haidinger, Maxwell's spot, or the ring of L&ouml;we; for these phenomena
disappear in a similar manner during movement.
Exner offers another and a highly suggestive explanation. He
says of the phenomenon (<i>op. citat.</i>, S. 47), &quot;This is obviously
related to the following fact, that objective and subjective
impressions are not to be distinguished as such, so long as the
eye is at rest, but that they are immediately distinguished if an
eye-movement is executed; for then the subjective phenomena
move with the eye, whereas the objective phenomena are not
displaced.... This neglect of the subjective phenomena is
effected, however, not by means of an act of will, but rather
by some central mechanism which, perhaps in the manner of a
reflex inhibition, withholds the stimulation in question from
consciousness, without our assistance and indeed without our
knowledge.&quot; The suggestion of a central mechanism which
brings about a reflex inhibition is the significant point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[6]</span><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>It is furthermore worth noting that movements of the eyelid
and changes in the accommodation also cause the after-images to
disappear (Fick and G&uuml;rber), whereas artificial displacement of
the eye, as by means of pressure from the finger, does not interfere
with the images (Exner).</p>

<p>Another motive for suspecting an&aelig;sthesia during eye-movement
is found by Dodge,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_5_5'>5</a> in the fact that, &quot;One may watch
one's eyes as closely as possible, even with the aid of a concave
reflector, whether one looks from one eye to the other, or from
some more distant object to one's own eyes, the eyes may be
seen now in one position and now in another, but never in
motion.&quot; This phenomenon was described by Graefe,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_6_6'>6</a> who
believed it was to be explained in the same way as the illusion
which one experiences in a railway coach when another train is
moving parallel with the coach in which one sits, in the same
direction and at the same speed. The second train, of course,
appears motionless.</p>

<p>This explanation of Graefe is not to be admitted, however,
since in the case of eye-movement there are muscular sensations
of one's own activity, which are not present when one merely
sits in a coach. These sensations of eye-movement are in all
cases so intimately connected with our perception of the movement
of objects, that they may not be in this case simply neglected.
The case of the eye trying to watch its own movement
in a mirror is more nearly comparable with the case in which
the eye follows the movement of some independent object, as a
race-horse or a shooting-star. In both cases the image remains
on virtually the same point of the retina, and in both cases
muscular sensations afford the knowledge that the eye is moving.
The shooting-star, however, is perceived to move, and
the question remains, why is not the eye in the mirror also seen
to move?</p>

<p>F. Ostwald<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_7_7'>7</a> refutes the explanation of Graefe from quite
different considerations, and gives one of his own, which depends
on the geometrical relations subsisting between the axes
<span class="pagenum">[7]</span><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>of vision of the real eye and its reflected image. His explanation
is too long to be here considered, an undertaking which
indeed the following circumstance renders unnecessary. While
it is true that the eye cannot observe the full sweep of its own
movement, yet nothing is easier than to observe its movement
through the very last part of the arc. If one eye is closed, and
the other is brought to within about six inches of an ordinary
mirror, and made to describe little movements from some adjacent
part of the mirror to its own reflected image, this image
can almost without exception be observed as just coming to rest.
That is, the very last part of the movement <i>can</i> be seen. The
explanation of Ostwald can therefore not be correct, for according
to it not alone some parts of the movement, but absolutely
all parts alike must remain invisible. It still remains, therefore,
to ask why the greater part of the movement eludes observation.
The correct explanation will account not only for the
impossibility of seeing the first part of the movement but also for
the possibility of seeing the remainder.</p>

<p>Apart from the experience of the eye watching itself in a
glass, Dodge (<i>loc. citat.</i>) found another fact which strongly suggested
an&aelig;sthesia. In the course of some experiments on
reading, conducted by Erdmann and Dodge, the question came
up, how &quot;to explain the meaning of those strangely rhythmic
pauses of the eye in reading every page of printed matter.&quot;
It was demonstrated (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 457) &quot;that the rhythmic pauses
in reading are the moments of significant stimulation.... If
a simple letter or figure is placed between two fixation-points so
as to be irrecognizable from both, no eye-movement is found to
make it clear, which does not show a full stop between them.&quot;</p>

<p>With these facts in view Dodge made an experiment to test
the hypothesis of an&aelig;sthesia. He proceeded as follows
(<i>ibid.</i>, p. 458): &quot;A disc of black cardboard thirteen inches in
diameter, in which a circle of one-eighth inch round holes, one
half inch apart, had been punched close to the periphery all
around, was made to revolve at such a velocity that, while the
light from the holes fused to a bright circle when the eye was
at rest, when the eye moved in the direction of the disc's rotation
from one fixation point, seen through the fused circle of
<span class="pagenum">[8]</span><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>light, to another one inch distant, three clear-cut round holes
were seen much brighter than the band of light out of which
they seemed to emerge. This was only possible when the
velocity of the holes was sufficient to keep their images at
exactly the same spot on the retina during the movement of the
eye. The significant thing is that the individual round spots of
light thus seen were much more intense than the fused line of
light seen while the eyes were at rest. Neither my assistant
nor I was able to detect any difference in brightness between
them and the background when altogether unobstructed.&quot;
Dodge finds that this experiment 'disproves' the hypothesis
of an&aelig;sthesia.</p>

<p>If by 'an&aelig;sthesia' is meant a condition of the retinal end-organs
in which they should be momentarily indifferent to excitation
by light-waves, the hypothesis is indeed disproved, for
obviously the 'three clear-cut round holes' which appeared as
bright as the unobstructed background were due to a summation
of the light which reached the retina during the movement,
through three holes of the disc, and which fell on the same
three spots of the retina as long as the disc and the eyeball
were moving at the same angular rate. But such a momentary
an&aelig;sthesia of the retina itself would in any case, from our
knowledge of its physiological and chemical structure, be
utterly inconceivable.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there seems to be nothing in the experiment
which shows that the images of the three holes were
present to consciousness just during the movement, rather than
immediately thereafter. A central mechanism of inhibition,
such as Exner mentions, might condition a central an&aelig;sthesia
during movement, although the functioning of the retina should
remain unaltered. Such a central an&aelig;sthesia would just as
well account for the phenomena which have been enumerated.
The three luminous images could be supposed to remain unmodified
for a finite interval as positive after-images, and as
such first to appear in consciousness. Inasmuch as 'the arc of
eye movements was 4.7&deg;' only, the time would be too brief to
make possible any reliable judgment as to whether the three
holes were seen during or just after the eye-movement. With
<span class="pagenum">[9]</span><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>this point in view, the writer repeated the experiment of Dodge,
and found indeed nothing which gave a hint as to the exact
time when the images emerged in consciousness. The results
of Dodge were otherwise entirely confirmed.</p>


<h3>II. THE PHENOMENON OF 'FALSELY LOCALIZED
AFTER-IMAGES.'</h3>

<p>A further fact suggestive of an&aelig;sthesia during movement
comes from an unexpected source. While walking in the street
of an evening, if one fixates for a moment some bright light
and then quickly turns the eye away, one will observe that a
luminous streak seems to dart out from the light and to shoot
away in either of two directions, either in the same direction as
that in which the eye moved, or in just the opposite. If the
eye makes only a slight movement, say of 5&deg;, the streak jumps
with the eye; but if the eye sweeps through a rather large arc,
say of 40&deg;, the luminous streak darts away in the opposite direction.
In the latter case, moreover, a faint streak of light appears
later, lying in the direction of the eye-movement.</p>

<p>This phenomenon was probably first described by Mach, in
1886.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_8_8'>8</a> His view is essentially as follows: It is clear that in
whatever direction the eye moves, away from its luminous fixation
point, the streak described on the retina by the luminous
image will lie on the same part of the retina as it would have
lain on had the eye remained at rest but the object moved in the
opposite direction. Thus, if the eye moves to the right, we
should expect the streak to appear to dart to the left. If, however,
the streak has not faded by the time the eye has come to
rest on a new fixation point (by supposition to the right of the
old), we should expect the streak to be localized to the left of
this, that is, to the right of the former fixation-point. In order
to be projected, a retinal image has to be localized with reference
to some point, generally the fixation-point of the eyes;
and it is therefore clear that when two such fixation-points are
involved, the localization will be ambiguous if for any reason
the central apparatus does not clearly determine which shall be
the point of reference. With regard to the oppositely moving
<span class="pagenum">[10]</span><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>streak Mach says:<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_9_9'>9</a> &quot;The streak is, of course, an after-image,
which comes to consciousness only on, or shortly before, the
completion of the eye-movement, nevertheless with positional
values which correspond, remarkably enough, not to the later
but to the earlier position and innervation of the eyes.&quot; Mach
does not further attempt to explain the phenomenon.</p>

<p>It is brought up again by Lipps,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_10_10'>10</a> who assumes that the
streak ought to dart with the eyes and calls therefore the
oppositely moving streak the 'falsely localized image.' For
sake of brevity we may call this the 'false image.' The
explanation of Lipps can be pieced together as follows (<i>ibid.</i>,
S. 64): &quot;The explanation presupposes that sensations of eye-movements
have nothing to do with the projection of retinal
impressions into the visual field, that is, with the perception of
the mutual relations as to direction and distance, of objects
which are viewed simultaneously.... Undoubtedly, however,
sensations of eye-movements, and of head-and body-movements
as well, afford us a scale for measuring the displacements
which our entire visual field and every point in
it undergo within the surrounding <i>totality of space</i>, which we
conceive of as fixed. We estimate according to the length of
such movements, or at least we deduce therefrom, the distance
through fixed space which our view by virtue of these movements
has traversed.... They themselves are nothing for
our consciousness but a series of purely intensive states. But
in experience they can come to <i>indicate</i> distance traversed.&quot;
Now in turning the eye from a luminous object, <i>O</i>, to some
other fixation-point, <i>P</i>, the distance as simply contemplated is
more or less subdivided or filled in by the objects which are
seen to lie between <i>O</i> and <i>P</i>, or if no such objects are visible
the distance is still felt to consist of an infinity of points;
whereas the muscular innervation which is to carry the eye
over this very distance is an undivided unit. But it is this
which gives us our estimate of the arc we move through, and
being thus uninterrupted it will appear shorter than the contemplated,
<span class="pagenum">[11]</span><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>much subdivided distance <i>OP</i>, just as a continuous
line appears shorter than a broken line. &quot;After such analogies,
now, the movement of the eye from <i>O</i> to <i>P</i>, that is, the
arc which I traverse, must be underestimated&quot; (<i>ibid.</i>, S. 67).
There is thus a discrepancy between our two estimates of the
distance <i>OP</i>. This discrepancy is felt during the movement,
and can be harmonized only if we seem to see the two fixation-points
move apart, until the arc between them, in terms of
innervation-feeling, feels equal to the distance <i>OP</i> in terms of
its visual subdivisions. Now either <i>O</i> and <i>P</i> can both seem to
move apart from each other, or else one can seem fixed while
the other moves. But the eye has for its goal <i>P</i>, which ought
therefore to have a definite position. &quot;<i>P</i> appears fixed because,
as goal, I hold it fast in my thought&quot; (<i>loc. citat.</i>). It
must be <i>O</i>, therefore, which appears to move; that is, <i>O</i> must
dart backward as the eye moves forward toward <i>P</i>. Thus
Lipps explains the illusion.</p>

<p>Such an explanation involves many doubtful presuppositions,
but if we were to grant to Lipps those, the following consideration
would invalidate his account. Whether the feeling of
innervation which he speaks of as being the underestimated
factor is supposed to be a true innervation-feeling in the narrower
sense, or a muscular sensation remembered from past
movements, it would in the course of experience certainly come
to be so closely associated with the corresponding objective
distance as not to feel less than this. So far as an innervation-feeling
might allow us to estimate distance, it could have no
other meaning than to represent just that distance through
which the innervation will move the organ in question. If <i>OP</i>
is a distance and <i>i</i> is the feeling of such an innervation as will
move the eye through that distance, it is inconceivable that <i>i</i>,
if it represent any distance at all, should represent any other
distance than just <i>OP</i>.</p>

<p>Cornelius<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_11_11'>11</a> brought up the matter a year later than Lipps.
Cornelius criticises the unwarranted presuppositions of Lipps,
and himself suggests that the falsely localized streak is due to
<span class="pagenum">[12]</span><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>a slight rebound which the eye, having overshot its intended
goal, may make in the opposite direction to regain the mark.
This would undoubtedly explain the phenomenon if such movements
of rebound actually took place. Cornelius himself does
not adduce any experiments to corroborate this account.</p>

<p>The writer, therefore, undertook to find out if such movements
actually are made. The observations were made by
watching the eyes of several subjects, who looked repeatedly
from one fixation-point to another. Although sometimes such
backward movements seemed indeed to be made, they were
very rare and always very slight. Inasmuch as the 'false'
streak is often one third as long as the distance moved through,
a movement of rebound, such as Cornelius means, would have
to be one third of the arc intended, and could therefore easily
have been noticed. Furthermore, the researches of Lamansky,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_12_12'>12</a>
Guillery,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_13_13'>13</a> Huey,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_14_14'>14</a> Dodge and Cline,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_15_15'>15</a> which are particularly
concerned with the movements of the eyes, make no mention
of such rebounds. Schwarz<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_16_16'>16</a> above all has made careful investigations
on this very point, in which a screen was so placed
between the observer and the luminous spot that it intervened
between the pupil and the light, just before the end of the movement.
Thus the retina was not stimulated during the latter part
of its movement, just when Cornelius assumed the rebound to
take place. This arrangement, however, did not in the least
modify the appearance of the false streak.</p>

<p>This work of Schwarz certainly proves that the explanation
of Cornelius is not correct. Schwarz found that the phenomenon
takes place as well when the head moves and the eyes
are fixed relatively to the head, as when the eyes alone move.
He furthermore made this observation. Meaning by <i>a</i> the point
of departure and by <i>b</i> the goal of either the eye-or the head-movement,
<span class="pagenum">[13]</span><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>movement, he says (<i>ibid.</i>, S. 400-2): &quot;While oftentimes the
streak of the after-image extended uninterruptedly to the point
<i>b</i>, or better seemed to proceed from this point,&mdash;as Lipps also
reported&mdash;yet generally, under the experimental conditions
which I have indicated, <i>two streaks</i> could be seen, <i>separated by
a dark space between</i>; firstly the anomalous one&quot; (the false
streak) &quot;rather brilliant, and secondly a fainter one of about
equal or perhaps greater length, which began at the new fixation-point
<i>b</i> and was manifestly an after-image correctly localized
with regard to the situation of this point. This last after-image
streak did not always appear; but it appeared regularly if
the light at <i>a</i> was bright enough and the background dark....
It was impossible for this second after-image streak
to originate in the point <i>b</i>, because it appeared equally when <i>b</i>
was only an imaginary fixation-point.... This consideration
makes it already conceivable that the two parts of the
total after-image <i>are two manifestations of the one identical
retinal stimulation, which are differently localized</i>....
Therefore we must probably picture to ourselves that the sensation
from the strip of the retina stimulated during the quick
eye-movement is, <i>during the interval of movement or at least
during the greater part of it, localized as if the axis of vision
were still directed toward the original fixation-point. And when
the new position of rest is reached and the disturbance on the
retinal strip has not wholly died away, then the strip comes once
more into consciousness, but this time correctly localized with
reference to the new position of the axis of vision</i>. By attending
closely to the behavior as regards time of both after-image
streaks, I can generally see the normal after-image develop a
moment later than the anomalous one&quot; (that is, the false streak).
Schwarz finally suggests (S. 404) that probably between the first
and second appearances of the streak an 'innervation-feeling'
intervenes which affords the basis for localizing the second streak
('correctly') with reference to the new position of the eye.</p>

<p>After this digression we return to consider how this phenomenon
is related to the hypothesis of an&aelig;sthesia during eye-movements.
If we accept the interpretation of Schwarz, there
is one retinal process which is perceived as two luminous streaks
<span class="pagenum">[14]</span><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>in space, localized differently and referred to different moments
of time. It is surprising, then, that a continuous retinal process
is subjectively interpreted as two quite different objects,
that is, as something discontinuous. Where does the factor of
discontinuity come in? If we suppose the retinal disturbance
to produce a continuous sensation in consciousness, we should
expect, according to every analogy, that this sensation would
be referred to one continuously existing object. And if this
object is to be localized in two places successively, we should
expect it to appear to move continuously through all intervening
positions. Such an interpretation is all the more to be expected,
since, as the strobic phenomena show, even discontinuous retinal
processes tend to be interpreted as continuously existing
objects.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if there were a central an&aelig;sthesia during
eye-movement, the continuous process in the retina could
not produce a continuous sensation, and if the interval were
long enough the image might well be referred to two objects;
since also, in the strobic appearances, the stimulations must
succeed at a certain minimal rate in order to produce the illusion
of continuous existence and movement.</p>

<p>This consideration seemed to make it worth while to perform
some experiments with the falsely localized after-images. The
phenomenon had also by chance been noted in the case of the
eye moving past a luminous dot which was being regularly
covered and uncovered. The appearance is of a row of luminous
spots side by side in space, which under conditions may
be either falsely or correctly localized. Since these dots seemed
likely to afford every phenomenon exhibited by the streaks,
with the bare chance of bringing out new facts, apparatus was
arranged as in Fig. 1, which is a horizontal section.</p>

<p><i>DD</i> is a disc which revolves in a vertical plane, 56 cm. in
diameter and bearing near its periphery one-centimeter holes
punched 3 cm. apart. <i>E</i> is an eye-rest, and <i>L</i> an electric
lamp. <i>SS</i> is a screen pierced at <i>H</i> by a one-centimeter hole.
The distance <i>EH</i> is 34 cm. The disc <i>DD</i> is so pivoted that
the highest point of the circle of holes lies in a straight line
between the eye <i>E</i> and the lamp <i>L</i>. The hole <i>H</i> lies also in
<span class="pagenum">[15]</span><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>this straight line. A piece of milk-glass <i>M</i> intervenes between
<i>L</i> and <i>H</i>, to temper the illumination. The disc <i>DD</i> is geared
to a wheel <i>W</i>, which can be turned by the hand of the observer
at <i>E</i>, or by a second person. As the disc revolves, each
hole in turn crosses the line <i>EL</i>. Thus the luminous hole <i>H</i> is
successively covered and uncovered to the eye <i>E</i>; and if the
eye moves, a succession of points on the retina is stimulated by
the successive uncovering of the luminous spot. No fixation-points
are provided for the eye, since such points, if bright
enough to be of use in the otherwise dark room, might themselves
produce confusing streaks, and also since an exact determination
of the arc of eye-movement would be superfluous.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="./images/022-fig1.png" width="531" height="397" alt="Fig. 1." title="" />
<p class="sccaption">Fig. 1.</p></div>

<p>The eye was first fixated on the light-spot, and then moved
horizontally away toward either the right or the left. In the
first few trials (with eye-sweeps of medium length), the observations
did not agree, for some subjects saw both the false and
the correct streaks, while others saw only the latter. It was
<span class="pagenum">[16]</span><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>found later that all the subjects saw both streaks if the arc of
movement was large, say 40&deg;, and all saw only the correctly
localized streak if the arc was small, say 5&deg;. Arcs of medium
length revealed individual differences between the persons, and
these differences, though modified, persisted throughout the
experiments. After the subjects had become somewhat trained
in observation, the falsely localized streak never appeared without
the correctly localized one as well. For the sake of brevity
the word 'streak' is retained, although the appearance now
referred to is that of a series of separate spots of light arranged
in a nearly straight line.</p>

<p>The phenomena are as follows.&mdash;(1) If the arc of movement
is small, a short, correctly localized streak is seen extending
from the final fixation-point to the light-spot. It is brightest
at the end nearer the light. (2) If the eye-movement is 40&deg; or
more, a streak having a length of about one third the distance
moved through is seen on the other side of the light from the
final fixation-point; while another streak is seen of the length
of the distance moved through, and extending from the final
fixation-point to the light. The first is the falsely, the second
the correctly localized streak. The second, which is paler than
the first, feels as if it appeared a moment later than this. The
brighter end of each streak is the end which adjoins the luminous
spot. (3) Owing to this last fact, it sometimes happens,
when the eye-movement is 40&deg; or a trifle less, that both streaks
are seen, but that the feeling of succession is absent, so that the
two streaks look like one streak which lies (unequally parted)
on both sides of the spot of light. It was observed, in agreement
with Schwarz, that the phenomenon was the same whether
the head or the eyes moved. Only one other point need be
noted. It is that the false streak, which appears in the beginning
to dart from the luminous hole, does not fade, but seems to
suffer a sudden and total eclipse; whereas the second streak
flashes out suddenly <i>in situ</i>, but at a lesser brilliancy than the
other, and very slowly fades away.</p>

<p>These observations thoroughly confirmed those of Schwarz.
And one could not avoid the conviction that Schwarz's suggestion
of the two streaks being separate localizations of the same
<span class="pagenum">[17]</span><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>retinal stimulation was an extremely shrewd conjecture. The
facts speak strongly in its favor; first, that when the arc of
movement is rather long, there is a distinct feeling of succession
between the appearances of the falsely and the correctly
localized images; second, that when both streaks are seen, the
correct streak is always noticeably dimmer than the false streak.</p>

<p>It is of course perfectly conceivable that the feeling of succession
is an illusion (which will itself then need to be
explained), and that the streak is seen continuously, its spacial
reference only undergoing an instantaneous substitution. If
this is the case, it is singular that the correctly seen streak
seems to enter consciousness so much reduced as to intensity
below that of the false streak when it was eclipsed. Whereas,
if a momentary an&aelig;sthesia could be demonstrated, both the
feeling of succession and the discontinuity of the intensities
would be explained (since during the an&aelig;sthesia the after-image
on the retina would have faded). This last interpretation
would be entirely in accordance with the observations of
McDougall,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_17_17'>17</a> who reports some cases in which after-images
are intermittently present to consciousness, and fade during
their eclipse, so that they reappear always noticeably dimmer
than when they disappeared.</p>

<p>Now if the event of such an an&aelig;sthesia could be established,
we should know at once that it is not a retinal but a central
phenomenon. We should strongly suspect, moreover, that
the an&aelig;sthesia is not present during the very first part of the
movement. This must be so if the interpretation of Schwarz
is correct, for certainly no part of the streak could be made
before the eye had begun to move; and yet approximately the
first third was seen at once in its original intensity, before
indeed the 'innervation-feelings' had reached consciousness.
Apparently the an&aelig;sthesia commences, it at all, after the eye
has accomplished about the first third of its sweep. And
finally, we shall expect to find that movements of the head no
less than movements of the eyes condition the an&aelig;sthesia,
since neither by Schwarz nor by the present writer was any
difference observed in the phenomena of falsely localized after-images,
<span class="pagenum">[18]</span><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>between the cases when the head, and those when the
eyes moved.</p>


<h3>III. THE PERIMETER-TEST OF DODGE, AND THE LAW OF
THE LOCALIZATION OF AFTER-IMAGES.</h3>


<p>We have seen (above, <a href="#Page_8">p. 8</a>) how the evidence which Dodge
adduces to disprove the hypothesis of an&aelig;sthesia is not conclusive,
since, although an image imprinted on the retina during
its movement was seen, yet nothing showed that it was seen
before the eye had come to rest.</p>

<p>Having convinced himself that there is after all no an&aelig;sthesia,
Dodge devised a very ingenious attachment for a perimeter
'to determine just what is seen during the eye-movement.'<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_18_18'>18</a>
The eye was made to move through a known arc, and
during its movement to pass by a very narrow slit. Behind
this slit was an illuminated field which stimulated the retina.
And since only during its movement was the pupil opposite the
slit, so only during the movement could the stimulation be
given. In the first experiments nothing at all of the illuminated
field was seen, and Dodge admits (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 461) that this
fact 'is certainly suggestive of a central explanation for the
absence of bands of fusion under ordinary conditions.' But
&quot;these failures suggested an increase of the illumination of the
field of exposure.... Under these conditions a long band
of light was immediately evident at each movement of the eye.&quot;
This and similar observations were believed 'to show experimentally
that when a complex field of vision is perceived during
eye-movement it is seen fused' (p. 462).</p>

<p>Between the 'failures' and the cases when a band of light
was seen, no change in the conditions had been introduced
except 'an increase of the illumination.' Suppose now this
change made just the difference between a stimulation which
left <i>no</i> appreciable <i>after-image</i>, and one which left <i>a distinct
one</i>. And is it even possible, in view of the extreme rapidity
of eye-movements, that a retinal stimulation of any considerable
intensity should not endure after the movement, to be <i>then</i>
perceived, whether or not it had been first 'perceived during
the movement'?<span class="pagenum">[19]</span><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></p>

<p>Both of Dodge's experiments are open to the same objection.
They do not admit of distinguishing between consciousness of
a retinal process during the moment of stimulation, and consciousness
of the same process just afterward. In both his
cases the stimulation was given during the eye-movement, but
there was nothing to prove that it was perceived at just the same
moment. Whatever the difficulties of demonstrating an an&aelig;sthesia
during movement, an experiment which does not observe
the mentioned distinction can never disprove the hypothesis.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="./images/026-fig2.png" width="555" height="398" alt="Fig. 2." title="" />
<p class="sccaption">Fig. 2.</p></div>

<p>For the sake of a better understanding of these bands of
light of Dodge, a perimeter was equipped in as nearly the
manner described by him (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 460) as possible. Experiments
with the eye moving past a very narrow illuminated slit
confirmed his observations. If the light behind the slit was
feeble, no band was seen; if moderately bright, a band was
always seen. The most striking fact, however, was that the
band was not localized behind the slit, but was projected on to
that point where the eye came to rest. The band seemed to
<span class="pagenum">[20]</span><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>appear at this point and there to hover until it faded away.
This apparent anomaly of localization, which Dodge does not
mention, suggests the localization which Schwarz describes of
his streaks. Hereupon the apparatus was further modified so
that, whereas Dodge had let the stimulation take place only
during the movement of the eye across a narrow slit between
two walls, now either one of these walls could be taken away,
allowing the stimulation to last for one half of the time of movement,
and this could be either the first or the second half at
pleasure. A plan of the perimeter so arranged is given in Fig. 2.</p>

<p><i>PBCDB'P</i> is the horizontal section of a semicircular
perimeter of 30 cm. radius. <i>E</i> is an eye-rest fixed at the
centre of the semicircle; <i>CD</i> is a square hole which is closed
by the screen <i>S</i> fitted into the front pair of the grooves <i>GG</i>.
In the center of <i>S</i> and on a level with the eye <i>E</i> is a hole <i>A</i>,
2 cm. in diameter, which contains a 'jewel' of red glass.
The other two pairs of grooves are made to hold pieces of
milk-or ground-glass, as <i>M</i>, which may be needed to temper
the illumination down to the proper intensity. <i>L</i> is an electric
lamp. <i>B</i> and <i>B'</i> are two white beads fixed to the perimeter at
the same level as <i>E</i> and <i>A</i>, and used as fixation-points.
Although the room is darkened, these beads catch enough light
to be just visible against the black perimeter, and the eye is
able to move from one to the other, or from <i>A</i> to either one,
with considerable accuracy. They leave a slight after-image
streak, which is, however, incomparably fainter than that left
by <i>A</i> (the streak to be studied), and which is furthermore white
while that of <i>A</i> is bright red. <i>B</i> and <i>B'</i> are adjustable along
a scale of degrees, which is not shown in the figure, so that the
arc of eye-movement is variable at will. <i>W</i> is a thin, opaque,
perpendicular wall extending from <i>E</i> to <i>C</i>, that is, standing on
a radius of the perimeter. At <i>E</i> this wall comes to within
about 4 mm. of the cornea, and when the eye is directed toward
<i>B</i> the wall conceals the red spot <i>A</i> from the pupil. <i>W</i> can at
will be transferred to the position <i>ED</i>. <i>A</i> is then hidden if
the eye looks toward <i>B'</i>.</p>

<p>The four conditions of eye-movement to be studied are indicated
in Fig. 3 (Plate I.). The location of the retinal stimulation
is also shown for each case, as well as the corresponding appearance
of the streaks, their approximate length, and above all
their localization. For the sake of simplicity the refractive
effect of the lens and humors of the eye is not shown, the
path of the light-rays being in each case drawn straight. In
all four cases the eye moved without stopping, through an
arc of 40&deg;.</p>

<p class="sccaption">Fig 3.<br />HOLT ON EYE-MOVEMENT.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[21]</span><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>To take the first case, Fig. 3:1. The eye fixates the light
<i>L</i>, then sweeps 40&deg; toward the right to the point <i>B'</i>. The
retina is stimulated throughout the movement, <i>l-l'</i>. These conditions
yield the phenomenon of both streaks, appearing as
shown on the black rectangle.</p>

<p>In the second case (Fig. 3:2) the wall <i>W</i> is in position and
the eye so adjusted in the eye-rest that the light <i>L</i> is not seen
until the eye has moved about 10&deg; to the right, that is, until the
axis of vision is at <i>Ex</i>. Clearly, then, the image of <i>L</i> falls at
first a little to the right of the fovea, and continues in indirect
vision to the end of the movement. The stimulated part of the
retina is <i>l-l'</i> (Fig. 3:2). Here, then, we have no stimulation
of the eye during the first part of its movement. The corresponding
appearance of the streak is also shown. Only the
correctly localized streak is seen, extending from the light <i>L</i>
toward the right but not quite reaching <i>B'</i>. Thus by cutting
out that portion of the stimulation which was given during the
first part of the movement, we have eliminated the whole of
the false image, and the right-hand (foveal) part of the correct
image.</p>

<p>Fig. 3:3 shows the reverse case, in which the stimulation
is given only during the first part of the movement. The wall
is fixed on the right of <i>L</i>, and the eye so adjusted that <i>L</i> remains
in sight until the axis of vision reaches position <i>Ex</i>, that
is, until it has moved about 10&deg;. A short strip of the retina
next the fovea is here stimulated, just the part which in case 2
was not stimulated; and the part which in case 2 was, is here
not stimulated. Now here the false streak is seen, together with
just that portion of the correct streak which in the previous case
was not seen. The latter is relatively dim.</p>

<p>Thus it looks indeed as if the streak given during the first
<span class="pagenum">[22]</span><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>part of an eye-movement is seen twice and differently localized.
But one may say: The twice-seen portion was in both cases
on the fovea; this may have been the conditioning circumstance,
and not the fact of being given in the early part of the
movement.</p>

<p>We must then consider Fig. 3, case 4. Here the eye moves
from <i>B</i> to <i>B'</i>, through the same arc of 40&deg;. The wall <i>W</i> is
placed so that <i>L</i> cannot be seen until the axis of vision has
moved from <i>EB</i> to <i>EL</i>, but <i>then L</i> is seen in direct vision. Its
image falls full on the fovea. But one streak, and that the
correctly localized one, is seen. This is like case 2, except that
here the streak extending from <i>L</i> to the right quite reaches the
final fixation-point <i>B'</i>. It is therefore not the fact of a stimulation
being foveal which conditions its being seen in two places.</p>

<p>It should be added that this experiment involves no particular
difficulties of observation, except that in case 4 the eye
tends to stop midway in its movement when the spot of light <i>L</i>
comes in view. Otherwise no particular training of the subject
is necessary beyond that needed for the observing of any after-image.
Ten persons made the foregoing observations and were
unanimous in their reports.</p>

<p>This experiment leaves it impossible to doubt that the conjecture
of Schwarz, that the correct image is only the false one
seen over again, is perfectly true. It would be interesting to
enquire what it is that conditions the length of the false streak.
It is never more than one third that of the correct streak (Fig.
3:1; except of course under the artificial conditions of Fig. 3:3)
and may be less. The false streak seems originally to <i>dart
out</i> from the light, as described by Lipps, visibly growing in
length for a certain distance, and then to be suddenly eclipsed
or blotted out <i>simultaneously</i> in all its parts. Whereas the
fainter, correct streak flashes into consciousness <i>all parts at
once</i>, but disappears by fading gradually from one end, the end
which lies farther from the light.</p>

<p>Certain it is that when the false streak stops growing and is
eclipsed, some new central process has intervened. One has
next to ask, Is the image continuously conscious, suffering only
an instantaneous relocalization, or is there a moment of central
<span class="pagenum">[23]</span><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>an&aelig;sthesia between the disappearance of the false streak and
the appearance of the other? The relative dimness of the
second streak in the <i>first moment</i> of its appearance speaks for
such a brief period of an&aelig;sthesia, during which the retinal
process may have partly subsided.</p>

<p>We have now to seek some experimental test which shall
demonstrate definitely either the presence or the absence of a
central an&aelig;sthesia during eye-movements. The question of
head-movements will be deferred, although, as we have seen
above, these afford equally the phenomenon of twice-localized
after-images.</p>


<h3>IV. THE PENDULUM-TEST FOR AN&AElig;STHESIA.</h3>

<p>A. Apparatus must be devised to fulfil the following conditions.
A retinal stimulation must be given during an eye-movement.
The moment of excitation must be so brief and its intensity
so low that the process shall be finished before the eye
comes to rest, that is, so that no after-image shall be left to
come into consciousness <i>after</i> the movement is over. Yet, on
the other hand, it must be positively demonstrated that a stimulation
of this <i>very same</i> brief duration and low intensity is amply
strong enough to force its way into consciousness if no eye-movement
is taking place. If such a stimulation, distinctly
perceived when the eye is at rest, should not be perceptible if
given while the eye is moving, we should have a valid proof
that some central process has intervened during the movement,
to shut out the stimulation-image during that brief moment
when it might otherwise have been perceived.</p>

<p>Obviously enough, with the perimeter arrangement devised
by Dodge, where the eye moves past a narrow, illuminated slit,
the light within the slit can be reduced to any degree of faintness.
But on the other hand, it is clearly impossible to find out
how long the moment of excitation lasts, and therefore impossible
to find out whether an excitation of the same duration and
intensity is yet sufficient to affect consciousness if given when
the eye is not moving. Unless the stimulation is proved to be
thus sufficient, a failure to see it when given during an eye-movement
would of course prove nothing at all.<span class="pagenum">[24]</span><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></p>

<p>Perhaps the most exact way to measure the duration of a
light-stimulus is to let it be controlled by the passing of a shutter
which is affixed to a pendulum. Furthermore, by means of
a pendulum a stimulation of exactly the same duration and
intensity can be given to the moving, as to the resting eye. Let
us consider Fig. 4:1. If <i>P</i> is a pendulum bearing an opaque
shield <i>SS</i> pierced by the hole <i>tt</i>, and <i>BB</i> an opaque background
pierced by the hole <i>i</i> behind which is a lamp, it is clear that if
the eye is fixed on <i>i</i>, a swing of the pendulum will allow <i>i</i> to
stimulate the retina during such a time as it takes the opening <i>tt</i>
to move past <i>i</i>. The shape of <i>i</i> will determine the shape of the
image on the retina, and the intensity of the stimulation can be
regulated by ground-or milk-glass interposed between the hole
<i>i</i> and the lamp behind it. The duration of the exposure can be
regulated by the width of <i>tt</i>, by the length of the pendulum,
and by the arc through which it swings.</p>

<p>If now the conditions are altered, as in Fig. 4:2, so that
the opening <i>tt</i> (indicated by the dotted line) lies not in <i>SS</i>, but
in the fixed background <i>BB</i>, while the small hole <i>i</i> now moves
with the shield <i>SS</i>, it necessarily follows that if the eye can
move at just the rate of the pendulum, it will receive a stimulation
of exactly the same size, shape, duration, and intensity as
in the previous case where the eye was at rest. Furthermore, it
will always be possible to tell whether the eye does move at the
same rate as the pendulum, since if it moves either more rapidly
or more slowly, the image of <i>i</i> on the retina will be horizontally
elongated, and this fact will be given by a judgment as to the
proportions of the image seen.</p>

<p>It may be said that since the eye does not rotate like the
pendulum, from a fulcrum above, the image of <i>i</i> in the case of
the moving eye will be distorted as is indicated in Fig. 4, <i>a</i>.
This is true, but the distortion will be so minute as to be negligible
if the pendulum is rather long (say a meter and a half)
and the opening <i>tt</i> rather narrow (say not more than ten degrees
wide). A merely horizontal movement of the eye will then
give a practically exact superposition of the image of <i>i</i> at all
moments of the exposure.</p>

HOLT ON EYE-MOVEMENT.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[25]</span><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>Thus much of preliminary discussion to show how, by means
of a pendulum, identical stimulations can be given to the moving
and to the resting eye. We return to the problem. It is to find
out whether a stimulation given during an eye-movement can
be perceived if its after-image is so brief as wholly to elapse
before the end of the movement. If a period of an&aelig;sthesia is
to be demonstrated, two observations must be made. First,
that the stimulation is bright enough to be <i>unmistakably visible</i>
when given to the eye at rest; second, that it is not visible
when given to the moving eye. Hence, we shall have three
cases.</p>

<div class='blkquot'><p>Case 1. A control, in which the stimulation is proved
intense enough to be seen by the eye at rest.</p>

<p>Case 2. In which the same stimulation is given to the
eye during movement.</p>

<p>Case 3. Another control, to make sure that no change
in the adaptation or fatigue of the eye has intervened
during the experiments to render the eye insensible to
the stimulation.</p></div>

<p>Fig. 5 shows the exact arrangement of the experiment.
The figure represents a horizontal section at the eye-level of
the pendulum of Fig. 4, with accessories. <i>E</i> is the eye which
moves between the two fixation-points <i>P</i> and <i>P</i>'. <i>WONW</i> is
a wall which conceals the mechanism of the pendulum from the
subject. <i>ON</i> is a rectangular hole 9 cm. wide and 7 cm. high,
in this wall. <i>SS</i> is the shield which swings with the pendulum,
and <i>BB</i> is the background (cf. Fig. 4). When the
pendulum is not swinging, a hole in the shield lies behind <i>ON</i>
and exactly corresponds with it. Another in the background
does the same. The eye can thus see straight through to the
light <i>L</i>.</p>

<p>Each of these three holes has grooves to take an opaque
card, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, or <i>z</i>; there are two cards for the three grooves, and
they are pierced with holes to correspond to <i>i</i> and <i>tt</i> of Fig. 4.
The background <i>BB</i> has a second groove to take a piece of
milk-glass <i>M</i>. These cards are shown in Fig. 6 (Plate II.)
Card <i>I</i> bears a hole 5 cm. high and shaped like a dumb-bell.
The diameter of the end-circles (<i>e</i>, <i>e</i>) is 1.3 cm., and the width
of the handle <i>h</i> is 0.2 cm. Card <i>T</i> is pierced by two slits<span class="pagenum">[26]</span><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>
<i>EE</i>, <i>EE</i>, each 9 cm. long and 1.3 cm. high, which correspond
to the two ends of the dumb-bell. These slits are connected
by a perforation <i>H</i>, 1.5 cm. wide, which corresponds
to the handle of the dumb-bell. This opening <i>EEHEE</i> is
covered by a piece of ground-glass which serves as a radiating
surface for the light.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="./images/035-fig5.png" width="346" height="405" alt="Fig. 5." title="" />
<p class="sccaption">Fig. 5.</p></div>

<p>The distance <i>EA</i> (Fig. 5) is 56 cm., and <i>PP</i>' is 40 cm.;
so that the arc of eye-movement, that is, the angle <i>PEP</i>', is
<span class="pagenum">[27]</span><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>very nearly 40&deg;, of which the 9-cm. opening <i>ON</i> 9&deg; 11'.
<i>SS</i> is 2 cm. behind <i>ON</i>, and <i>BB</i> 2 cm. behind <i>SS</i>; these
distances being left to allow the pendulum to swing freely.</p>

<p>It is found under these conditions that the natural speed
made by the eye in passing the 9-cm. opening <i>ON</i> is very well
approximated by the pendulum if the latter is allowed to fall
through 23.5&deg; of its arc, the complete swing being therefore
47&deg;. The middle point of the pendulum is then found to move
from <i>O</i> to <i>N</i> in 110&sigma;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_19_19'>19</a>. If the eye sweeps from <i>O</i> to <i>N</i> in the
same time, it will be moving at an angular velocity of 1&deg; in
11.98&sigma; (since the 9 cm. are 9&deg; 11' of eye-movement). This
rate is much less than that found by Dodge and Cline (<i>op. cit.</i>,
p. 155), who give the time for an eye-movement of 40&deg; as 99.9&sigma;,
which is an average of only 2.49&sigma; to the degree. Voluntary
eye-movements, like other voluntary movements, can of
course be slow or fast according to conditions. After the pendulum
has been swinging for some time, so that its amplitude
of movement has fallen below the initial 47&deg; and therewith its
speed past the middle point has been diminished, the eye in its
movements back and forth between the fixation-points can still
catch the after-image of <i>i</i> perfectly distinct and not at all horizontally
elongated, as it would have to be if eye and pendulum
had not moved just together. It appears from this that certain
motives are able to retard the rate of voluntary movements of
the eye, even when the distance traversed is constant.</p>

<p>The experiment is now as follows. The room is darkened.
Card <i>T</i> is dropped into groove <i>z</i>, while <i>I</i> is put in groove <i>y</i>
and swings with the pendulum. One eye alone is used.</p>

<p>Case 1. The eye is fixed in the direction <i>EA</i>. The pendulum
is allowed to swing through its 47&deg;. The resulting visual
image is shown in Fig. 7:1. Its shape is of course like <i>T</i>,
Fig. 6, but the part <i>H</i> is less bright than the rest because it is
exposed a shorter time, owing to the narrowness of the handle
of the dumb-bell, which swings by and mediates the exposure.
Sheets of milk-glass are now dropped into the back groove of<span class="pagenum">[28]</span><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>
<i>BB</i>, until the light is so tempered that part <i>H</i> (Fig. 7:1) is
<i>barely but unmistakably</i> visible as luminous. The intensity
actually used by the writer, relative to that of <i>EE</i>, is fairly
shown in the figure. (See Plate III.)</p>

<p>It is clear, if the eye were now to move with the pendulum,
that the same amount of light would reach the retina, but that
it would be concentrated on a horizontally narrower area. And
if the eye moves exactly with the pendulum, the visual image
will be no longer like 1 but like 2 (Fig. 7). We do not as yet
know how the intensities of <i>e</i>, <i>e</i> and <i>h</i> will relatively appear.
To ascertain this we must put card <i>I</i> into groove <i>x</i>, and let card
<i>T</i> swing with the pendulum in groove <i>y</i>. If the eye is again
fixed in the direction <i>EA</i> (Fig. 5), the retina receives exactly
the same stimulation that it would have received before the
cards were shifted if it had moved exactly at the rate of the
pendulum. In the experiments described, the handle <i>h</i> of this
image (Fig. 7:2) curiously enough appears of the same brightness
as the two ends <i>e</i>, <i>e</i>, although, as we know, it is stimulated
for a briefer interval. Nor can any difference between <i>e</i>, <i>e</i> and
<i>h</i> be detected in the time of disappearance of their after-images.
These conditions are therefore generous. The danger is that <i>h</i>
of the figure, the only part of the stimulation which could possibly
quite elapse during the movement, is still too bright to do so.</p>

<p>Case 2. The cards are replaced in their first positions, <i>T</i> in
groove <i>z</i>, <i>I</i> in groove <i>y</i> which swings. The subject is now
asked to make voluntary eye-sweeps from <i>P</i> to <i>P'</i> and back,
timing his moment of starting so as to bring his axis of vision
on to the near side of opening <i>ON</i> at approximately the same
time as the pendulum brings <i>I</i> on the same point. This is
a delicate matter and requires practice. Even then it would be
impossible, if the subject were not allowed to get the rhythm of
the pendulum before passing judgment on the after-images.
The pendulum used gives a slight click at each end of its swing,
and from the rhythm of this the subject is soon able to time the
innervation of his eye so that the exposure coincides with the
middle of the eye-movement.</p>

<div class="center"><a name="PLATE3"></a><span class="sc">Psychological Review. Monograph Supplement, 17. Plate III.</span>

<p class="sccaption">Fig. 7.<br />
HOLT ON EYE-MOVEMENT.</p></div>


<p><span class="pagenum">[29]</span><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>It is true that with every swing the pendulum moves more
slowly past <i>ON</i>, and the period of exposure is lengthened.
This, however, only tends to make the retinal image brighter,
so that its disappearance during an an&aelig;sthesia would be so much
the less likely. The pendulum may therefore be allowed to
'run down' until its swing is too slow for the eye to move with
it, that is, too slow for a distinct, non-elongated image of <i>i</i> to be
caught in transit on the retina.</p>

<p>With these eye-movements, the possible appearances are of
two classes, according to the localization of the after-image.
The image is localized either at <i>A</i> (Fig. 5), or at the final
fixation-point (<i>P</i> or <i>P'</i>, according to the direction of the movement).
Localized at <i>A</i>, the image may be seen in either of two
shapes. First, it may be identical with 1, Fig. 7. It is seen
somewhat peripherally, judgment of indirect vision, and is correctly
localized at <i>A</i>. When the subject's eye is watched, it is
found that in this case it moved either too soon or too late, so
that when the exposure was made, the eye was resting quietly
on one of the fixation-points and so naturally received the same
image as in case 1, except that now it lies in indirect vision, the
eye being directed not toward <i>A</i> (as in case 1) but towards either
<i>P</i> or <i>P'</i>.</p>

<p>Second, the image correctly localized may be like 2 (Fig.
7), and then it is seen to move past the opening <i>ON</i>. The
handle <i>h</i> looks as bright as <i>e</i>, <i>e</i>. This appearance once obtained
generally recurs with each successive swing of the pendulum,
and scrutiny of the subject's eye shows it to be moving, not by
separate voluntary innervations from <i>P</i> to <i>P'</i> and then from <i>P'</i>
to <i>P</i>, but continuously back and forth with the swing of the
pendulum, much as the eye of a child passively follows a moving
candle. This movement is purely reflex,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_20_20'>20</a> governed probably
by cerebellar centers. It seems to consist in a rapid succession
of small reflex innervations, and is very different from
the type of movement in which one definite innervation carries
the eye through its 42&deg;, and which yielded the phenomena
with the perimeter. A subject under the spell of this reflex
must be exercised in innervating his eye to move from <i>P</i> to <i>P'</i><span class="pagenum">[30]</span><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>
and back in single, rapid leaps. For this, the pendulum is to
be motionless and the eye is not to be stimulated during its
movement.</p>

<p>These two cases in which the image is localized midway
between <i>P</i> and <i>P'</i> interest us no further. Localized on the
final fixation-point, the image is always felt to flash out suddenly
<i>in situ</i>, just as in the case of the 'correctly localized'
after-image streaks in the experiments with the perimeter.
The image appears in one of four shapes, Fig. 7: 2 or 3, 4 or 5.</p>

<p>First, the plain or elongated outline of the dumb-bell
appears with its handle on the final fixation-point (2 or 3). The
image is plain and undistorted if the eye moves at just the rate
of the pendulum, elongated if the eye moves more rapidly or
more slowly. The point that concerns us is that the image
appears <i>with its handle</i>. Two precautions must here be
observed.</p>

<p>The eye does not perhaps move through its whole 42&deg;, but
stops instead just when the exposure is complete, that is, stops
on either <i>O</i> or <i>N</i> and considerably short of <i>P</i> or <i>P'</i>. It then
follows that the exposure is given at the <i>very last</i> part of the
movement, so that the after-image of even the handle <i>h</i> has not
had time to subside. The experiment is planned so that the
after-image of <i>h</i> shall totally elapse during that part of the
movement which occurs after the exposure, that is, while the
eye is completing its sweep of 42&deg;, from <i>O</i> to <i>P</i>, or else from
<i>N</i> to <i>P'</i>. If the arc is curtailed at point <i>O</i> or <i>N</i>, the handle
of the dumb-bell will of course appear. The fact can always
be ascertained by asking the subject to notice very carefully
where the image is localized. If the eye does in fact stop
short at <i>O</i> or <i>N</i>, the image will be there localized, although
the subject may have thoughtlessly said before that it was at
<i>P</i> or <i>P'</i>, the points he had nominally had in mind.</p>

<p>But the image 2 or 3 may indeed be localized quite over the
final fixation-point. In this case the light is to be looked to.
It is too bright, as it probably was in the case of Dodge's
experiments. It must be further reduced; and with the eye at
rest, the control (case I) must be repeated. In the experiments
here described it was always found possible so to reduce the
<span class="pagenum">[31]</span><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>light that the distinct, entire image of the dumb-bell (2, Fig.
7) never appeared localized on the final fixation-point, although
in the control, <i>H</i>, of Fig. 7:1, was always distinctly visible.</p>

<p>With these two precautions taken, the image on the final
fixation-point is like either 3, 4, or 5. Shape 5 very rarely
appears, while the trained subject sees 4 and 3 each about one
half the times; and either may be seen for as many as fifteen
times in succession.</p>

<p>Shape 4 is of course exactly the appearance which this
experiment takes to be crucial evidence of a moment of central
an&aelig;sthesia, before the image is perceived and during which the
stimulation of the handle <i>h</i> completely elapses. Eight subjects
saw this phenomenon distinctly and, after some training in
timing their eye-movements, habitually. The first appearance
of the handleless image was always a decided surprise to the
subject (as also to the writer), and with some eagerness each
hastened to verify the phenomenon by new trials.</p>

<p>The two ends (<i>e</i>, <i>e</i>) of the dumb-bell seem to be of the same
intensity as in shape 2 when seen in reflex movement. But
there is no vestige whatsoever of a handle. Two of the subjects
stated that for them the place where the handle should
have been, appeared of a velvety blackness more intense than the
rest of the background. The writer was not able to make this
observation. It coincides interestingly with that of von Kries,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_21_21'>21</a>
who reports as to the phases of fading after-images, that between
the disappearance of the primary image and the appearance
of the 'ghost,' a moment of the most intense blackness
intervenes. The experiments with the pendulum, however,
brought out no ghost.</p>

<p>We must now enquire why in about half the cases shape 3
is still seen, whereas shape 5 occurs very rarely. Some of the
subjects, among whom is the writer, never saw 5 at all. We
should expect that with the intensity of <i>H</i> sufficiently reduced
4 and 5 would appear with equal frequency, whereas 3 would
be seen no oftener than 2; shape 5 appearing when the eye did
not, and 4 when it did, move at just the rate of the pendulum.<span class="pagenum">[32]</span><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>
It is certain that when 4 is seen, the eye has caught just the
rate of the pendulum, and that for 3 or 5 it has moved at some
other rate. We have seen above (<a href="#Page_27">p. 27</a>) that to move with the
pendulum the eye must already move decidedly more slowly
than Dodge and Cline find the eye generally to move. Nothing
so reliable in regard to the rate of voluntary eye-movements
as these measurements of Dodge and Cline had been published
at the time when the experiments on an&aelig;sthesia were carried
on, and it is perhaps regrettable that in the 'empirical' approximation
of the natural rate of the eye through 40&deg; the pendulum
was set to move so slowly.</p>

<p>In any case it is highly probable that whenever the eye did
not move at just the rate of the pendulum, it moved <i>more
rapidly</i> rather than more slowly. The image is thus horizontally
elongated, by an amount which varies from the least possible
up to 9 cm. (the width of the opening in <i>T</i>), or <i>even
more</i>. And while the last of the movement (<i>O</i> to <i>P</i>, or <i>N</i> to
<i>P'</i>), in which the stimulation of <i>H'</i> is supposed to subside, is
indeed executed, it may yet be done so <i>rapidly</i> that after all <i>H'</i>
cannot subside, not even although it is now less intense by
being horizontally spread out (that is, less concentrated than
the vanished <i>h</i> of shape 4). This explanation is rendered
more probable by the very rare appearance of shape 5, which
must certainly emerge if ever the eye were to move more slowly
than the pendulum.</p>

<p>The critical fact is, however, that shape 4 <i>does</i> appear to a
trained subject in about one half the trials&mdash;a very satisfactory
ratio when one considers the difficulty of timing the beginning
of the movement and its rate exactly to the pendulum.</p>

<p>Lastly, in some cases no image appears at all. This was at
first a source of perplexity, until it was discovered that the image
of the dumb-bell, made specially small so as to be contained
within the area of distinct vision, could also be contained on the
blind-spot. With the pendulum at rest the eye could be so fixed
as to see not even the slight halo which diffuses in the eye and
seems to lie about the dumb-bell. It may well occur, then, that
in a movement the image happens to fall on the blind-spot and
not on the fovea. That this accounts for the cases where no
<span class="pagenum">[33]</span><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>image appears, is proved by the fact that if both eyes are used,
some image is always seen. A binocular image under normal
convergence can of course not fall on both blind-spots. It may
be further said that the shape 4 appears as well when both eyes
are used as with only one. The experiment may indeed as well
be carried on with both eyes.</p>

<p>Some objections must be answered. It may be said that the
image of <i>h</i> happens to fall on the blind-spot, <i>e</i> and <i>e</i> being above
and below the same. This is impossible, since the entire image
and its halo as well may lie within the blind-spot. If now <i>h</i> is
to be on the blind-spot, at least one of the end-circles <i>e</i>, <i>e</i> will
be there also, whereas shape 4 shows both end-circles of the
dumb-bell with perfect distinctness.</p>

<p>Again, it cannot properly be urged that during the movement
the attention was distracted so as not to 'notice' the
handle. The shape of a dumb-bell was specially chosen for the
image so that the weaker part of the stimulation should lie between
two points which should be clearly noticed. Indeed, if anything,
one might expect this central, connecting link in the
image to be apperceptively filled in, even when it did not come
to consciousness as immediate sensation. And it remains to ask
what it is which should distract the attention.</p>

<p>In this connection the appearance under reflex eye-movement
compares interestingly with that under voluntary. If the
wall <i>WONW</i> (Fig. 5) is taken from before the pendulum, and
the eye allowed to move reflexly with the swinging dumb-bell,
the entire image is seen at each exposure, the handle seeming
no less bright than the end-circles. Moreover, as the dumb-bell
opening swings past the place of exposure and the image
fades, although the handle must fade more quickly than the
ends, yet this is not discernible, and the entire image disappears
without having at any time presented the handleless appearance.</p>

<p>B. Another test for this an&aelig;sthesia during movement is
offered in the following experiment. It is clear that, just as a
light-stimulation is not perceived if the whole retinal process begins
and ends during a movement, so also a particular phase of it
should not be perceived if that phase can be given complete
within the time of the movement. The same pendulum which
<span class="pagenum">[34]</span><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>was used in the previous experiment makes such a thing possible.
If in place of the perforated dumb-bell the pendulum
exposes two pieces of glass of nearly complementary colors,
one after the other coming opposite the place of exposure, the
sensations will fuse or will not fuse according as the pendulum
swings rapidly or slowly. But now a mean rate of succession
can be found such as to let the first color be seen pure before
the second is exposed, and then to show the second fused with
the after-image of the first. Under some conditions the second
will persist after the first has faded, and will then itself be seen
pure. Thus there may be three phases in consciousness. If the
first color exposed is green and the second red, the phases of
sensation will be green, white, and perhaps red. These phases
are felt to be not simultaneous but successive. A modification
of this method is used in the following experiment. (See Fig.
8, Plate IV.)</p>

<p><i>T</i> and <i>I</i> here correspond to the cards <i>T</i> and <i>I</i> of Fig. 6.
<i>T</i> consists of a rectangular opening, 9&times;5 cm., which contains
three pieces of glass, two pieces of green at the ends, each 2.8
cm. wide and 7 cm. high, and a piece of red glass in the
middle 3.4 cm. wide and only 1.5 cm. high, the space above
and below this width being filled with opaque material. The
shape of the image is determined as before by the hole in <i>I</i>,
which now, instead of being a dumb-bell, is merely a rectangular
hole 2 cm. wide and 5 cm. high. Exactly as before, <i>T</i>
is fixed in the background and <i>I</i> swings with the pendulum,
the eye moving with it.</p>

<p>The speed of the pendulum must be determined, such that
if <i>I</i> lies in the front groove (Fig. 5, <i>x</i>) and the eye is at rest,
the image will clearly show two phases of color when <i>T</i>
swings past on the pendulum. With <i>T</i> and <i>I</i> as described
above, a very slow pendulum shows the image green, red (narrow),
and green, in succession. A very fast pendulum shows
only a horizontal straw-yellow band on a green field (Fig.
8:5). There is but one phase and no feeling of succession.
Between these two rates is one which shows two phases&mdash;the
first a green field with a horizontal, reddish-orange band (Fig.
8:3), the second quickly following, in which the band is straw-yellow (5).
It might be expected that this first phase would be
preceded by an entirely green phase, since green is at first exposed.
Such is however not the case. The straw-yellow of
the last phase is of course the fusion-color of the red and green
glasses. It would be gray but that the two colors are not perfectly
complementary. Since the arrangement of colors in <i>T</i>
is bilaterally symmetrical, the successive phases are the same
in whichever direction the pendulum swings.</p>

<div class="center"><a name="PLATE4"></a><span class="sc">Psychological Review. Monograph Supplement, 17. Plate IV.</span>

HOLT ON EYE-MOVEMENT.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[35]</span><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>It is desirable to employ the maximum rate of pendulum
which will give the two phases. For this the illumination
should be very moderate, since the brighter it is, the slower
must be the pendulum. With the degree of illumination used
in the experiments described, it was found that the pendulum
must fall from a height of only 9.5&deg; of its arc: a total swing of
19&deg;. The opening of <i>T</i>, which is 9 cm. wide, then swings
past the middle point of <i>I</i> in 275&sigma;.</p>

<p>Now when the eye moves it must move at this rate. If the
eye is 56 cm. distant from the opening, as in the previous case,
the 9 cm. of exposure are 9&deg; 11' of eye-movement, and we saw
above that 9&deg; 11' in 110&sigma; is a very slow rate of movement,
according to the best measurements. Now it is impossible for
the eye to move so slowly as 9&deg; 11' in 275&sigma;. If, however, the
eye is brought nearer to the opening, it is clear that the 9 cm.
of exposure become more than 9&deg; 11' of eye-movement. Therefore
the eye and the fixation-points are so placed that <i>EA</i> (Fig.
5) = 26 cm. and <i>PP'</i> = 18 cm. The total eye-movement is
thus 38&deg; 11', of which the nine-centimeter distance of exposure
is 19&deg; 38'. Now the eye is found to move very well through
19&deg; 38' in 275&sigma;, although, again, this is much more than a
proportionate part of the total time (99.9&sigma;) given by Dodge and
Cline for a movement of the eye through 40&deg;. The eye is in
this case also moving slowly. As before, it is permissible to
let the pendulum run down till it swings too slowly for the eye
to move with it; since any lessened speed of the pendulum only
makes the reddish-orange phase more prominent.</p>

<p>As in the experiment with the dumb-bell, we have also here
three cases: the control, the case of the eye moving, and again
a control.<span class="pagenum">[36]</span><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></p>

<p>Case 1. <i>T</i> swings with the pendulum. <i>I</i> is placed in
the front groove, and the eye looks straight forward
without moving. The pendulum falls from 9.5&deg; at
one side, and the illumination is so adjusted that the
phase in which the band is reddish-orange, is <i>unmistakably</i>
perceived before that in which it is straw-yellow.
The appearance must be 3 followed by 5
(Fig. 8).</p>

<p>Case 2. <i>T</i> is fixed in the background, <i>I</i> on the pendulum,
and the phenomena are observed with the eye
moving.</p>

<p>Case 3. A repetition of case 1, to make sure that no different
adaptation or fatigue condition of the eye has
come in to modify the appearance of the two successive
phases as at first seen.</p>

<p>The possible appearances to the moving eye are closely
analogous to those in the dumb-bell experiment. If the eye
moves too soon or too late, so that it is at rest during the exposure,
the image is like <i>T</i> itself (Fig. 8) but somewhat fainter and
localized midway between the points <i>P</i> and <i>P'</i>. If the eye
moves reflexly at the rate of the pendulum, the image is of the
shape <i>i</i> and shows the two phases (3 followed by 5). It is
localized in the middle and appears to move across the nine-centimeter
opening.</p>

<p>A difficulty is met here which was not found in the case of
the dumb-bell. The eye is very liable to come to a full stop on
one of the colored surfaces, and then to move quickly on again
to the final fixation-point. And this happens contrary to the
intention of the subject, and indeed usually without his knowledge.
This stopping is undoubtedly a reflex process, in which
the cerebellar mechanism which tends to hold the fixation on
any bright object, asserts itself over the voluntary movement
and arrests the eye on the not moving red or green surface as
the exposure takes place. A comparable phenomenon was
found sometimes in the experiment with the dumb-bell, where an
eye-movement commenced as voluntary would end as a reflex
following of the pendulum. In the present experiment, until
the subject is well trained, the stopping of the eye must be
<span class="pagenum">[37]</span><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>watched by a second person who looks directly at the eye-ball
of the subject during each movement. The appearances are
very varied when the eye stops, but the typical one is shown in
Fig. 8:1. The red strip <i>AB</i> is seldom longer and often shorter
than in the figure. That part of it which is superposed on the
green seldom shows the orange phase, being almost always of
a pure straw-yellow. The localization of these images is variable.
All observations made during movements in which the eye
stops, are of course to be excluded.</p>

<p>If now the eye does not stop midway, and the image is not
localized in the center, the appearance is like either 2, 4, or 5,
and is localized over the final fixation-point. 2 is in all probability
the case of the eye moving very much faster than the
pendulum, so that if the movement is from left to right, the
right-hand side of the image is the part first exposed (by the
uncovering of the left-hand side of <i>T</i>), which is carried ahead by
the too swift eye-movement and projected in perception on the
right of the later portion. 3 is the case of the eye moving at
very nearly but not quite the rate of the pendulum. The image
which should appear 2 cm. wide (like the opening <i>i</i>) appears
about 3 cm. wide. The middle band is regularly straw-yellow,
extremely seldom reddish, and if we could be sure that the eye
moves more slowly than the pendulum, so that the succession of
the stimuli is even slower than in the control, and the red phase
is surely given, this appearance (3) would be good evidence of
an&aelig;sthesia during which the reddish-orange phase elapses. It
is more likely, however, that the eye is moving faster than the
pendulum, but whether or not so inconsiderably faster as still to
let the disappearance of the reddish phase be significant of
an&aelig;sthesia, is not certain until one shall have made some possible
but tedious measurements of the apparent width of the after-image.
Both here and in the following case the <i>feeling of succession</i>,
noticeable between the two phases when the eye is at
rest, has <i>disappeared with the sensation of redness</i>.</p>

<p>The cases in which 5 is seen are, however, indisputably
significant. The image is apparently of just the height and
width of <i>i</i>, and there is not the slightest trace of the reddish-orange
phase. The image flashes out over the final fixation-point,
<span class="pagenum">[38]</span><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>green and straw-yellow, just as the end-circles of the
dumb-bell appeared without their handle. The rate of succession
of the stimuli, green&mdash;red&mdash;green, on the retina, is identical
with that rate which showed the two phases to the resting eye:
for the pendulum is here moving at the very same rate, and the
eye is moving exactly with the pendulum, as is shown by the
absence of any horizontal elongation of the image seen. The
trained subject seldom sees any other images than 4 and 5, and
these with about equal frequency, although either is often seen
in ten or fifteen consecutive trials. As in the cases of the
falsely localized images and of the handleless dumb-bell, movements
of both eyes, as well as of the head but not the eyes,
yield the same phenomena. It is interesting again to compare
the appearance under reflex movement. If at any time during
the experiments the eye is allowed to follow the pendulum
reflexly, the image is at once and invariably seen to pass
through its two phases as it swings past the nine-centimeter
opening.</p>

<p>The frequent and unmistakable appearance of this band of
straw-yellow on a non-elongated green field <i>without the
previous phase in which the band is reddish-orange</i>, although
this latter was unmistakable when the same stimulation was
given to the eye at rest, is authenticated by eight subjects. <i>This
appearance, together with that of the handleless dumb-bell, is
submitted as a demonstration that during voluntary movements
of the eyes, and probably of the head as well, there is a moment
in which stimulations are not transmitted from the retina to
the cerebral cortex, that is, a moment of central an&aelig;sthesia</i>.
The reason for saying 'and <i>probably</i> of the head as well,' is
that although the phenomena described are gotten equally
well from movements of the head, yet it is not perfectly certain
that when the head moves the eyes do not also move slightly
within the head, even when the attempt is made to keep them
fixed.</p>

<p>Most of the criticisms which apply to this last experiment
apply to that with the dumb-bell and have already been
answered. There is one however which, while applying to
that other, more particularly applies here. It would be, that
<span class="pagenum">[39]</span><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>these after-images are too brief and indistinct to be carefully
observed, so that judgments as to their shape, size, and color
are not valid evidence. This is a perfectly sensible criticism,
and a person thoroughly convinced of its force should repeat
the experiments and decide for himself what reliance he will
place on the judgments he is able to make. The writer and
those of the subjects who are most trained in optical experiments
find the judgments so simple and easily made as not to
be open to doubt.</p>

<p>In the first place, it should be remembered that only those
cases are counted in which the movement was so timed that the
image was seen in direct vision, that is, was given on or very
near the fovea. In such cases a nice discrimination of the
shape and color of the images is easily possible.</p>

<p>Secondly, the judgments are in no case quantitative, that is,
they in no case depend on an estimate of the absolute size of
any part of the image. At most the proportions are estimated.
In the case of the dumb-bell the question is, Has the figure a
handle? The other question, Are the end-circles horizontally
elongated? has not to be answered with mathematical accuracy.
It is enough if the end-circles are approximately round, or
indeed are narrower than 9 cm. horizontally, for at even that
low degree of concentration the handle was still visible to the
resting eye. Again, in the experiment with the color-phases,
only two questions are essential to identify the appearance 5:
Does the horizontal yellow band extend quite to both edges of
the image? and, Is there certainly no trace of red or orange to
be seen? The first question does not require a quantitative
judgment, but merely one as to whether there is any green
visible to the right or left of the yellow strip. Both are therefore
strictly questions of quality. And the two are sufficient to
identify appearance 5, for if no red or orange is visible,
images 1, 2, and 3 are excluded; and if no green lies to the
right or left of the yellow band, image 4 is excluded. Thus if
one is to make the somewhat superficial distinction between
qualitative and quantitative judgments, the judgments here
required are qualitative. Moreover, the subjects make these
judgments unhesitatingly.<span class="pagenum">[40]</span><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></p>

<p>Finally, the method of making judgments on after-images is
not new in psychology. Lamansky's well-known determination
of the rate of eye-movements<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_22_22'>22</a> depends on the possibility of
counting accurately the number of dots in a row of after-images.
A very much bolder assumption is made by Guillery<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_23_23'>23</a> in another
measurement of the rate of eye-movements. A trapezoidal
image was generated on the moving retina, and the after-image
of this was projected on to a plane bearing a scale of lines inclining
at various angles. On this the degree of inclination of
one side of the after-image was read off, and thence the speed of
the eye-movement was calculated. In spite of the boldness of
this method, a careful reading of Guillery's first article cited
above will leave no doubt as to its reliability, and the accuracy
of discrimination possible on these after-images.</p>

<p>As to judgments on the color and color-phases of after-images,
there is ample precedent in the researches of von Helmholtz,
Hering, Hess, von Kries, Hamaker, and Munk. It is
therefore justifiable to assume the possibility of making accurately
the four simple judgments of shape and color described
above, which are essential to the two proofs of an&aelig;sthesia.</p>


<h3>V. SUMMARY AND COROLLARIES OF THE EXPERIMENTS,
AND A PARTIAL, PHYSIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION
OF THE CENTRAL AN&AElig;STHESIA.</h3>

<p>We have now to sum up the facts given by the experiments.
The fact of central an&aelig;sthesia during voluntary movement is
supported by two experimental proofs, aside from a number of
random observations which seem to require this an&aelig;sthesia for
their explanation. The first proof is that if an image of the
shape of a dumb-bell is given to the retina during an eye-movement,
and in such a way that the handle of the image, while
positively above the threshold of perception, is yet of brief
enough duration to fade completely before the end of the movement,
it then happens that both ends of the dumb-bell are seen
but the handle not at all. The fact of its having been properly
<span class="pagenum">[41]</span><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>given to the retina is made certain by the presence of the now
disconnected ends.</p>

<p>The second proof is that, similarly, if during an eye-movement
two stimulations of different colors are given to the retina,
superposed and at such intensity and rate of succession as would
show to the resting eye two successive phases of color (in the
case taken, reddish-orange and straw-yellow), it then happens
that the first phase, which runs its course and is supplanted by
the second before the movement is over, is not perceived at all.
The first phase was certainly given, because the conditions of
the experiment require the orange to be given if the straw-yellow
is, since the straw-yellow which is seen can be produced
only by the addition of green to the orange which is not seen.</p>

<p>These two phenomena seem inevitably to demonstrate a
moment during which a process on the retina, of sufficient duration
and intensity ordinarily to determine a corresponding conscious
state, is nevertheless prevented from doing so. One
inclines to imagine a retraction of dendrites, which breaks the
connection between the central end of the optic nerve and the
occipital centers of vision.</p>

<p>The fact of an&aelig;sthesia demonstrated, other phenomena are
now available with further information. From the phenomena
of the 'falsely localized' images it follows that at least in voluntary
eye-movements of considerable arc (30&deg; or more), the
an&aelig;sthesia commences appreciably later than the movement.
The falsely localized streak is not generated before the eye
moves, but is yet seen before the correctly localized streak, as
is shown by the relative intensities of the two. The an&aelig;sthesia
must intervene between the two appearances. The conjecture
of Schwarz, that the fainter streak is but a second appearance
of the stronger, is undoubtedly right.</p>

<p>We know too that the an&aelig;sthesia depends on a mechanism
central of the retina, for stimulations are received during movement
but not transmitted to consciousness till afterward. This
would be further shown if it should be found that movements
of the head, no less than those of the eyes, condition the an&aelig;sthesia.
As before said, it is not certain that the eyes do not move
slightly in the head while the head moves. The movement of
<span class="pagenum">[42]</span><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>the eyes must then be very slight, and the an&aelig;sthesia correspondingly
either brief or discontinuous. Whereas, the phenomena
are the same when the head moves 90&deg; as when the
eyes move that amount. It seems probable, then, that voluntary
movements of the head do equally condition the an&aelig;sthesia.</p>

<p>We have seen, too, that in reflex eye-or head-movements no
an&aelig;sthesia is so far to be demonstrated. The closeness with
which the eye follows the unexpected gyrations of a slowly
waving rush-light, proves that the reflex movement is produced
by a succession of brief impulses (probably from the cerebellum),
each one of which carries the eye through only a very short
distance. It is an interesting question, whether there is an
instant of an&aelig;sthesia for each one of these involuntary innervations&mdash;an
instant too brief to be revealed by the experimental
conditions employed above. The seeming continuity of the
sensation during reflex movement would of course not argue
against such successive instants of an&aelig;sthesia, since no discontinuity
of vision during voluntary movement is noticeable,
although a relatively long moment of an&aelig;sthesia actually intervenes.</p>

<p>But decidedly the most interesting detail about the an&aelig;sthesia
is that shown by the extreme liability of the eye to stop
reflexly on the red or the green light, in the second experiment
with the pendulum. Suppose the eye to be moving from <i>P</i> to
<i>P'</i> (Fig. 5); the an&aelig;sthesia, although beginning later than the
movement, is present when the eye reaches <i>O</i>, while it is between
<i>O</i> and <i>N</i>, that is, during the an&aelig;sthetic moment, that the
eye is reflexly caught and held by the light. This proves again
that the an&aelig;sthesia is not retinal, but it proves very much more;
namely, that <i>the retinal stimulation is transmitted to those lower
centers which mediate reflex movements, at the very instant
during which it is cut off from the higher, conscious centers</i>.
The great frequency with which the eye would stop midway in
its movements, both in the second pendulum-experiment and in
the repetition of Dodge's perimeter-test, was very annoying at
the time, and the observation cannot be questioned. The fact
of the habitual reflex regulation of voluntary movements is
<span class="pagenum">[43]</span><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>otherwise undisputed. Exner<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_24_24'>24</a> mentions a variety of similar
instances. Also, with the moving dumb-bell, as has been
mentioned, the eye having begun a voluntary sweep would
often be caught by the moving image and carried on thereafter
reflexly with the pendulum. These observations hang
together, and prove a connection between the retina and the
reflex centers even while that between the retina and the conscious
centers is cut off.</p>

<p>But shall we suppose that the 'connection' between the
retina and the conscious centers is cut off during the central
an&aelig;sthesia? All that the facts prove is that the centers are at
that time not conscious. It would be at present an unwarrantable
assumption to make, that these centers are therefore disconnected
from the retina, at the optic thalami, the superior
quadrigeminal bodies, or wheresoever. On broad psychological
grounds the action-theory of M&uuml;nsterberg<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_25_25'>25</a> has proposed
the hypothesis that cerebral centers fail to mediate consciousness
not merely when no stimulations are transmitted to them,
but rather when the stimulations transmitted are not able to
pass through and out. The stimulation arouses consciousness
when it finds a ready discharge. And indeed, in this particular
case, while we have no other grounds for supposing stimulations
<i>to</i> the visual centers to be cut off, we do have other
grounds for supposing that egress <i>from</i> these cells would be
impeded.</p>

<p>The occipital centers which mediate sensations of color are
of course most closely associated with those other centers (probably
the parietal) which receive sensations from the eye-muscles
and which, therefore, mediate sensations which furnish space
and position to the sensations of mere color. Now it is these
occipital centers, mediators of light-sensations merely, which
the experiments have shown most specially to be an&aelig;sthetic.
The discharge of such centers means particularly the passage
of excitations on to the parietal localization-centers. There are
doubtless other outlets, but these are the chief group. The
<span class="pagenum">[44]</span><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>movements, for instance, which activity of these cells produces,
are first of all eye-movements, which have to be <i>directly</i> produced
(according to our present psychophysical conceptions)
by discharges from the centers of eye-muscle sensation. The
principal direction of discharge, then, from the color-centers is
toward the localization-centers.</p>

<p>Now the experiment with falsely and correctly localized
after-images proves that before the an&aelig;sthesia all localization
is with reference to the point of departure, while afterwards it
is with reference to the final fixation-point. The transition is
abrupt. During the an&aelig;sthesia, then, the mechanism of localization
is suffering a readjustment. It is proved that during this
interval of readjustment in the centers of eye-muscle sensation
the way is closed to oncoming discharges from the color-centers;
but it is certain that any such discharge, during this complicated
process of readjustment, would take the localization-centres
by surprise, as it were, and might conceivably result in
untoward eye-movements highly prejudicial to the safety of the
individual as a whole. The much more probable event is the
following:</p>

<p>Although Schwarz suggests that the moment between seeing
the false and seeing the correct after-image is the moment that
consciousness is taken up with 'innervation-feelings' of the
eye-movement, this is impossible, since the innervation-feelings
(using the word in the only permissible sense of remembered
muscle-sensations) must <i>precede</i> the movement, whereas even
the first-seen, falsely localized streak is not generated till the
movement commences. But we do have to suppose that during
the visual an&aelig;sthesia, muscle-sensations of <i>present</i> movement
are streaming to consciousness, to form the basis of the new
post-motum localization. And these would have to go to those
very centers mentioned above, the localization-centers or eye-muscle
sensation centers. One may well suppose that these
incoming currents so raise the tension of these centers that for
the moment no discharge can take place thither from other parts
of the brain, among which are the centers for color-sensations.
The word 'tension' is of course a figure, but it expresses the
familiar idea that centers which are in process of receiving
<span class="pagenum">[45]</span><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>peripheral stimulations, radiate that energy <i>to</i> other parts of the
brain (according to the neural dispositions), and probably do
not for the time being receive communications therefrom, since
those other parts are now less strongly excited. It is, therefore,
most probable that during the incoming of the eye-muscle sensations
the centers for color are in fact not able to discharge
through their usual channels toward the localization-centers,
since the tension in that direction is too high. If, now, their
other channels of discharge are too few or too little used to
come into question, the action-theory would find in this a simple
explanation of the visual an&aelig;sthesia.</p>

<p>The fact that the an&aelig;sthesia commences appreciably later
than the movement so far favors this interpretation. For if the
an&aelig;sthesia is conditioned by high tension in the localization-centers,
due to incoming sensations from the eye-muscles, it
could not possibly commence synchronously with the movement.
For, first the sensory end-organs in the eye-muscles (or perhaps
in the ligaments, surfaces of the eye-sockets, etc.) have their
latent period; then the stimulation has to travel to the brain;
and lastly it probably has to initiate there a summation-process
equivalent to another latent period. These three processes
would account very readily for what we may call the latent
period of the an&aelig;sthesia, as observed in the experiments. It is
true that this latent period was observed only in long eye-and
head-movements, but the experiments were not delicate enough
in this particular to bring out the finer points.</p>

<p>Finally, the conditioning of an&aelig;sthesia by movements of the
head, if really proved, would rather corroborate this interpretation.
For of course the position of the head on the shoulders is
as important for localization of the retinal picture as the position
of the eyes in the head, so that sensations of head-movements
must be equally represented in the localization
centers; and head movements would equally raise the tension
on those centers against discharge-currents from the color-centers.</p>

<p>The conclusion from the foregoing experiments is that
voluntary movements of the eyes condition a momentary, visual,
central an&aelig;sthesia.</p>

<h2><a name="PER2" id="PER2"></a>TACTUAL ILLUSIONS.</h2>

<h4>BY CHARLES H. RIEBER.</h4>

<h3>I.</h3>


<p>Many profound researches have been published upon the
subject of optical illusions, but in the field of tactual illusions
no equally extensive and serious work has been accomplished.
The reason for this apparent neglect of the illusions of touch is
obviously the fact that the studies in the optical illusions are generally
thought to yield more important results for psychology
than corresponding studies in the field of touch. Then, too, the
optical studies are more attractive by reason of the comparative
ease and certainty with which the statistics are gathered there.
An optical illusion is discovered in a single instance of the phenomenon.
We are aware of the illusion almost immediately.
But in the case of most of the illusions of touch, a large number
of experiments is often necessary in order to reveal any approximately
constant error in the judgments. Nevertheless, it seems
to me that the factors that influence our judgments of visual
space, though their effects are nearly always immediately apparent,
are of no more vital significance for the final explanation
of the origin of our notion of space than the disturbing factors
in our estimations of tactual space whose effects are not so
open to direct observation.</p>

<p>The present investigation has for its main object a critical
examination of the tactual illusions that correspond to some of
the well-known optical illusions, in the hope of segregating
some of the various disturbing factors that enter into our very
complex judgments of tactual space. The investigation has
unavoidably extended into a number of near-lying problems in
the psychology of touch, but the final object of my paper will
be to offer a more decisive answer than has hitherto been given
to the question, <i>Are the optical illusions also tactual illusions, or
are they reversed for touch?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[48]</span><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>Those who have given their attention to illusions of sight and
touch are rather unequally divided in their views as to whether
the geometrical optical illusions undergo a reversal in the field of
touch, the majority inclining to the belief that they are reversed.
And yet there are not wanting warm adherents of the opposite
view. A comparison of the two classes of illusions, with this
question in view, appears therefore in the present state of divergent
opinion to be a needed contribution to experimental psychology.
Such an experimental study, if it succeeds in finding the
solution to this debate, ought to throw some further light upon
the question of the origin of our idea of space, as well as upon
the subject of illusions of sense in general. For, on the one hand,
if touch and sight function alike in our judgment of space, we
should expect that like peripheral disturbances in the two senses
would cause like central errors in judgment, and every tactual
analogue of an optical illusion should be found to correspond
both in the direction of the error and, to a certain extent, quantitatively
with the optical illusion. But if, on the other hand, they
are in their origin and in their developed state really disparate
senses, each guided by a different psychological principle, the
illusion in the one sense might well be the reverse of the corresponding
illusion in the other sense. Therefore, if the results
of an empirical study should furnish evidence that the illusions
are reversed in passing from one field to the other, we should
be obliged to conclude that we are here in the presence of
what psychologists have been content to call the 'unanalyzable
fact' that the two senses function differently under the same
objective conditions. But if, on the contrary, it should turn out
that the illusions are not reversed for the two senses, then the
theory of the ultimate uniformity of the psychical laws will have
received an important defence.</p>

<p>These experiments were carried on in the Harvard Psychological
Laboratory during the greater part of the years 1898-1901.
In all, fifteen subjects co&ouml;perated in the work at different
times.</p>

<p>The experimental work in the direction of a comparison of
the optical illusions with the tactual illusions, to the time of the
present investigation, has been carried on chiefly with the familiar
<span class="pagenum">[49]</span><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>optical illusion of the overestimation of filled space. If the
distance between two points be divided into two equal parts by
a point midway between them, and the one of the halves be
filled with intermediate points, the filled half will, to the eye,
appear longer than the open half. James<a name="FNanchor_1_26" id="FNanchor_1_26"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_1_26'>1</a> says that one may
easily prove that with the skin we underestimate a filled space,
'by taking a visiting card, and cutting one edge of it into a
saw-toothed pattern, and from the opposite edge cutting out all
but two corners, and then comparing the feelings aroused by
the two edges when held against the skin.' He then remarks,
'the skin seems to obey a different law here from the eye.'
This experiment has often been repeated and verified. The
most extensive work on the problem, however, is that by Parrish.<a name="FNanchor_2_27" id="FNanchor_2_27"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_2_27'>2</a>
It is doubtless principally on the results of Parrish's experiments
that several authors of text-books in psychology have
based their assertions that a filled space is underestimated by the
skin. The opposite conclusion, namely, that the illusion is not
reversed for the skin, has been maintained by Thi&eacute;ry,<a name="FNanchor_3_28" id="FNanchor_3_28"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_3_28'>3</a> and Dresslar.<a name="FNanchor_4_29" id="FNanchor_4_29"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_4_29'>4</a>
Thi&eacute;ry does not, so far as I know, state the statistics on
which he bases his view. Dresslar's experiments, as Parrish
has correctly observed, do not deal with the proper analogue of
the optical illusion for filled space. The work of Dresslar will
be criticised in detail when we come to the illusions for active
touch.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the present investigation, the preponderance
of testimony was found to be in favor of the view that
filled space is underestimated by the skin; and this view is
invariably accompanied by the conclusion, which seems quite
properly to follow from it, that the skin and the eye do not
function alike in our perception of space. I began my work,
however, in the belief that there was lurking somewhere in the
earlier experiments a radical error or oversight. I may say
here, parenthetically, that I see no reason why experimental
psychologists should so often be reluctant to admit that they
begin certain investigations with preconceptions in favor of the
<span class="pagenum">[50]</span><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>theory which they ultimately defend by the results of their
experiments. The conclusions of a critical research are in no
wise vitiated because those conclusions were the working hypotheses
with which the investigator entered upon his inquiry.
I say frankly, therefore, that although my experiments developed
many surprises as they advanced, I began them in the
belief that the optical illusions are not reversed for touch. The
uniformity of the law of sense perception is prejudiced if two
senses, when affected by the same objective conditions, should
report to consciousness diametrically opposite interpretations
of these same objective facts. I may say at once, in advance
of the evidence upon which I base the assertion, that the belief
with which I began the experiments has been crystallized into
a firm conviction, namely, that neither the illusion for open or
filled spaces, nor any other optical illusion, is genuinely reversed
for touch.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>


<p>I began my work on the problem in question by attempting
to verify with similar apparatus the results of some of the previous
investigations, in the hope of discovering just where the
suspected error lay. It is unnecessary for me to give in detail
the results of these preliminary series, which were quite in agreement
with the general results of Parrish's experiments. Distances
of six centimeters filled with points varying in number
and position were, on the whole, underestimated in comparison
with equal distances without intermediate point stimulations.
So, too, the card with saw-toothed notches was judged shorter
than the card of equal length with all but the end points cut out.</p>

<p>After this preliminary verification of the previous results, I
was convinced that to pass from these comparatively meager
statistics, gathered under limited conditions in a very special
case, to the general statement that the optical illusion is reversed
in the field of touch, is an altogether unwarranted procedure.
When one reads the summarized conclusions of these previous
investigators, one finds it there assumed or even openly asserted
that the objective conditions of the tactual illusion are precisely
the same as those of the optical illusion. But I contend that it
is not the real analogue of the optical illusion with which these
<span class="pagenum">[51]</span><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>experiments have been concerned. The objective conditions
are not the same in both. Although something that is very
much like the optical illusion is reversed, yet I shall attempt to
prove in this part of my paper, first, that the former experiments
have not been made with the real counterpart of the optical illusion;
second, that the optical illusion can be quite exactly reproduced
on the skin; third, that where the objective conditions
are the same, the filled cutaneous space is overestimated, and
the illusion thus exists in the same sense for both sight and
touch.</p>

<p>Let me first call attention to some obvious criticisms on Parrish's
experiments. They were all made with one distance,
namely, 6.4 centimeters; and on only one region, the forearm.
Furthermore, in these experiments no attempt was made to control
the factor of pressure by any mechanical device. The experimenter
relied entirely on the facility acquired by practice to
give a uniform pressure to the stimuli. The number of judgments
is also relatively small. Again, the open and filled spaces
were always given successively. This, of course, involves the
comparison of a present impression with the memory of a somewhat
remote past impression, which difficulty can not be completely
obviated by simply reversing the order of presentation.
In the optical illusion, the two spaces are presented simultaneously,
and they lie adjacent to each other. It is still a debated
question whether this illusion would exist at all if the two spaces
were not given simultaneously and adjacent. M&uuml;nsterberg<a name="FNanchor_5_30" id="FNanchor_5_30"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_5_30'>5</a>
says of the optical illusion for the open and filled spaces, &quot;I
have the decided impression that the illusion does not arise from
the fact of our comparing one half with the other, but from the
fact that we grasp the line as a whole. As soon as an interval
is inserted, so that the perception of the whole line as constituted
of two halves vanishes, the illusion also disappears.&quot; This is
an important consideration, to which I shall return again.</p>

<p>Now, in my experiments, I endeavored to guard against all
of these objections. In the first place, I made a far greater
number of tests. Then my apparatus enabled me, firstly, to
<span class="pagenum">[52]</span><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>use a very wide range of distances. Where the points are set
in a solid block, the experiments with long distances are practically
impossible. Secondly, the apparatus enabled me to control
accurately the pressure of each point. Thirdly, the contacts
could be made simultaneously or successively with much
precision. This apparatus (Fig. 1) was planned and made in
the Harvard Laboratory, and was employed not only in our
study of this particular illusion, but also for the investigation of
a number of allied problems.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="./images/063-fig1.png" width="460" height="402" alt="" title="" />
<p class="sccaption">Fig. 1.</p></div>

<p>Two &aelig;sthesiometers, A and B, were arranged in a framework,
so that uniform stimulations could be given on both arms.
The &aelig;sthesiometers were raised or lowered by means of the
crank, C, and the cams, D and E. The contacts were made
either simultaneously or successively, with any interval between
them according to the position of the cams on the crank. The
height of the &aelig;sthesiometer could be conveniently adjusted by
the pins F and H. The shape of the cams was such that the
<span class="pagenum">[53]</span><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>descent of the &aelig;sthesiometer was as uniform as the ascent, so
that the contacts were not made by a drop motion unless that
was desired. The sliding rules, of which there were several
forms and lengths, could be easily detached from the upright
rods at <i>K</i> and <i>L</i>. Each of the points by which the contacts
were made moved easily along the sliding rule, and could be
also raised or lowered for accommodation to the unevenness of
the surface of the skin. These latter were the most valuable
two features of the apparatus. There were two sets of points,
one of hard rubber, the other of metal. This enabled me to
take into account, to a certain extent, the factor of temperature.
A wide range of apparent differences in temperature was
secured by employing these two stimuli of such widely different
conductivity. Then, as each point was independent of the rest
in its movements, its weight could also be changed without
affecting the rest.</p>

<p>In the first series of experiments I endeavored to reproduce
for touch the optical illusion in its exact form. There the open
and the filled spaces are adjacent to each other, and are presented
simultaneously for passive functioning of the eye, which
is what concerns us here in our search for the analogue of
passive touch. This was by no means an easy task, for
obviously the open and the filled spaces in this position on the
skin could not be compared directly, owing to the lack of uniformity
in the sensibility of different portions of the skin. At
first, equivalents had to be established between two collinear
open spaces for the particular region of the skin tested. Three
points were taken in a line, and one of the end points was
moved until the two adjacent open spaces were pronounced
equal. Then one of the spaces was filled, and the process of
finding another open space equivalent to this filled space was
repeated as before. This finding of two equivalent open spaces
was repeated at frequent intervals. It was found unsafe to
determine an equivalent at the beginning of each sitting to be
used throughout the hour.</p>

<p>Two sets of experiments were made with the illusion in this
form. In one the contacts were made simultaneously; the
results of this series are given in Table I. In the second set of
<span class="pagenum">[54]</span><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>experiments the central point which divided the open from the
filled space touched the skin first, and then the others in
various orders. The object of this was to prevent fusion of the
points, and, therefore, to enable the subject to pronounce his
judgments more rapidly and confidently. A record of these
judgments is given in Table II. In both of these series the
filled space was always taken near the wrist and the open space
in a straight line toward the elbow, on the volar side of the
arm. At present, I shall not undertake to give a complete
interpretation of the results of these two tables, but simply call
attention to two manifest tendencies in the figures. First, it
will be seen that the short filled distance of four centimeters is
underestimated, but that the long filled distance is overestimated.
Second, in Table II., which represents the judgments when the
contacts were made successively, the tendency to underestimate
the short distance is less, and at the same time we notice a more
pronounced overestimation of the longer filled distances. I
shall give a further explanation of these results in connection
with later tables.</p>

<div class="tblexp"><p>The first two numbers in the first line signify that when an open distance of
4 cm. was taken, an adjacent open distance of 4.7 cm. was judged equal; but
when the adjacent space was filled, 5.3 cm. was judged equal. Each number
in the column of filled distances represents an average of five judgments. All
of the contacts in Table I. were made simultaneously; in Table II. they were
made successively.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[55]</span><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>In the next series of experiments the illusion was approached
from an entirely different point of view. The two points representing
the open space were given on one arm, and the filled
space on a symmetrical part of the other arm. I was now able
to use a much wider range of distances, and made many variations
in the weights of the points and the number that were
taken for the filled distance.</p>

<p>However, before I began this second series, in which one of
the chief variations was to be in the weights of the different
points, I made a brief preliminary series of experiments to determine
in a general way the influence of pressure on judgments
of point distances. Only three distances were employed, four,
six and twelve centimeters, and three weights, twelve, twenty
and forty grams. Table III. shows that, for three men who
were to serve as subjects in the main experiments that are to
follow, an increase in the weight of the points was almost always
accompanied by an increase in the apparent distance.</p>

<div class="tblexp"><p>In the standard distances the points were each weighted to 6 grams. The
first three figures signify that a two-point distance of 4 cm., each point weighing
6 grams, was judged equal to 3.9 cm. when each point weighed 12 grams.
3.2 cm. when each point weighed 20 grams, etc. Each figure is the average of
five judgments.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[56]</span><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>Now the application of this principle in my criticism of Parrish's
experiments, and as anticipating the direction which the
following experiments will take, is this: if we take a block
such as Parrish used, with only two points in it, and weight it
with forty grams in applying it to the skin, it is plain that each
point will receive one half of the whole pressure, or twenty
grams. But if we put a pressure of forty grams upon a block
of eight points, each point will receive only one eighth of the
forty, or five grams. Thus, in the case of the filled space, the
end points, which play the most important part in the judgment
of the distance, have each only five grams' pressure, while the
points in the open space have each twenty grams. We should,
therefore, naturally expect that the open space would be overestimated,
because of the decided increase of pressure at these
significant points. Parrish should have subjected the blocks,
not to the same pressure, but to a pressure proportional to the
number of points in each block. With my apparatus, I was
easily able to prove the correctness of my position here. It
will be seen in Tables IV. to VIII. that, when the sum of the
weights of the two end points in the open space was only just
equal to the sum of the weights of all the points in the filled
space, the filled space was underestimated just as Parrish has
reported. But when the points were all of the same weight,
both in the filled and the open space, the filled space was judged
longer in all but the very short distances. For this latter exception
I shall offer an explanation presently.</p>

<p>Having now given an account of the results of this digression
into experiments to determine the influence of pressure
upon point distances, I shall pass to the second series of experiments
on the illusion in question. In this series, as has been
already stated, the filled space was taken on one arm and the
open on the other, and then the process was reversed in order to
eliminate any error arising from a lack of symmetry between
the two regions. Without, for the present, going into a detailed
explanation of the statistics of this second series of experiments,
<span class="pagenum">[57]</span><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>which are recorded in Tables IV., V., VI., VII. and VIII., I
may summarize the salient results into these general conclusions:
First, the short filled distance is underestimated; second, this
underestimation of the filled space gradually decreases until in
the case of the filled distance of 18 cm. the judgments pass
over into pronounced overestimations; third, an increase in the
number of points of contact in the shorter distances increases
the underestimation, while an increase in the number of points
in the longer distance increases the overestimation; fourth, an
increase of pressure causes an invariable increase in the apparent
length of space. If a general average were made of the
results given in Tables IV., V., VI., VII. and VIII., there
would be a preponderance of evidence for the conclusion that
the filled spaces are overestimated. But we cannot ignore the
marked tendencies in the opposite direction for the long and the
short distances. These anomalous results, which, it will be remembered,
were also found in our first series, call for explanation.
Several hypotheses were framed to explain these fluctuations
in the illusion, and then some shorter series of experiments
were made in different directions with as large a number of
variations in the conditions as possible, in the hope of discovering
the disturbing factors.</p>

<p>The first line in column <i>A</i> (Table IV.) signifies that out of 10 judgments,
comparing an open space 4 cm., total weight 20 gr., with a filled space of 4
points, total weight also 20 gr., the filled space was judged less 7 times, equal 2
times, and greater once.<span class="pagenum">[59]</span><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></p></div>


<h3>III.</h3>


<p>The results of the investigation, thus far, point to the conclusion
that short filled spaces are underestimated, that long
spaces are overestimated, and that between the two there lies
what might be called an 'indifference zone.' This unexpected
outcome explains, I think, the divergent opinions of the earlier
investigators of this problem. Each theory is right in what it
affirms, but wrong in what it implicitly or openly denies.</p>

<p>I next set out to determine as precisely as possible how far
the factor of fusion, or what Parrish has called irradiation,
enters into the judgments. It was evident from the beginning
of this whole investigation that fusion or displacement of the
points was very common. The term 'irradiation' is, however,
too specific a term to describe a process that works in
these two opposite directions. The primary concern of these
next experiments was, therefore, to devise means for preventing
fusion among the points before the subject pronounced his
judgment. With our apparatus we were able to make a number
of experiments that show, in an interesting way, the results
that follow when the sensations are not permitted to fuse. It is
only the shorter distances that concern us here. The longer
distances have already been shown to follow the law of optical
illusion, that is, that filled space is overestimated. The object
of the present experiments is to bring the shorter distances
under the same law, by showing, first, that the objective conditions
as they have existed in our experiments thus far are not
parallel to those which we find in the optical illusion. Second,
that when the objective conditions are the same, the illusion
for the shorter distances follows the law just stated.</p>

<p>In repeating some of the experiments reported in Tables
IV.-VIII. with varying conditions, I first tried the plan of using
metallic points at the ends of the spaces. Thus, by an apparent
difference in the temperature between the end points and
the filling, the sensations from the end points, which play the
most important part in the judgment of the length, were to a
certain extent kept from fusing with the rest. The figures in
Table II. have already shown what may be expected when the
points are kept from fusing. Here, also, a marked tendency
<span class="pagenum">[60]</span><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>in the direction of apparent lengthening of the distance was at
once observed. These short filled distances, which had before
been underestimated, were now overestimated. The same results
follow when metallic points are alternated with hard
rubber points in the filling itself.</p>

<p>This changing of the apparent temperature of the end points
has, it must be admitted, introduced another factor; and it
might be objected that it was not so much the prevention of
fusion as the change in the temperature that caused the judgments
to drift towards overestimation. I have statistics to show
that this observation is in a way just. Extremes in temperature,
whether hot or cold, are interpreted as an increase in the amount
of space. This conclusion has also been reported from a number
of other laboratories. My contention at this point is simply
that there are certain conditions under which these distances
will be overestimated and that these are the very conditions
which bring the phenomenon into closer correspondence with
the optical illusion, both as to the stimuli and the subjective experience.
Then, aside from this, such an objection will be seen
to be quite irrelevant if we bear in mind that when the end points
in the filled distance were replaced by metallic points, metallic
points were also employed in the open distance. The temperature
factor, therefore, entered into both spaces alike. By approaching
the problem from still another point of view, I obtained
even more conclusive evidence that it is the fusion of the
end points with the adjacent points in the short distances that
leads to the underestimation of these. I have several series in
which the end points were prevented from fusing into the filling,
by raising or lowering them in the apparatus, so that they
came in contact with the skin just after or before the intermediate
points. When the contacts were arranged in this way, the
tendency to underestimate the filled spaces was very much lessened,
and with some subjects the tendency passed over into a
decided overestimation. This, it will be seen, is a confirmation
of the results in Table II.</p>

<p>I have already stated that the two series of experiments reported
in Section II. throughout point to the conclusion that an
increase of pressure is taken to mean an increase in the distance.<span class="pagenum">[61]</span><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>
I now carried on some further experiments with short filled distances,
making variations in the place at which the pressure was
increased. I found a maximum tendency to underestimate
when the central points in the filled space were weighted more
than the end points. A strong drift in the opposite direction
was noticed when the end points were heavier than the intermediate
ones. It is not so much the pressure as a whole, as
the place at which it is applied, that causes the variations in the
judgments of length. In these experiments the total weights of
the points were the same in both cases. An increase of the
weight on the end points with an equivalent diminution of the
weights on the intervening points gave the end points greater
distinctness apparently and rendered them less likely to disappear
from the judgments.</p>

<p>At this stage in the inquiry as to the cause of the underestimation
of short distances, I began some auxiliary experiments
on the problem of the localization of cutaneous impressions,
which I hoped would throw light on the way in which the fusion
or displacement that I have just described takes place. These
studies in the localization of touch sensations were made partly
with a modification of the Jastrow &aelig;sthesiometer and partly with
an attachment to the apparatus before described (Fig. 1). In
the first case, the arm upon which the impressions were given
was screened from the subject's view, and he made a record of
his judgments on a drawing of the arm. The criticism made by
Pillsbury<a name="FNanchor_6_31" id="FNanchor_6_31"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_6_31'>6</a> upon this method of recording the judgments in the
localization of touch sensations will not apply to my experiments,
for I was concerned only with the relative, not with the
absolute position of the points. In the case of the other experiments,
a card with a single line of numbered points was placed
as nearly as possible over the line along which the contacts had
been made on the arm. The subject then named those points
on the card which seemed directly over the points which had
been touched.</p>

<p>The results from these two methods were practically the
same. But the second method, although it obviously permitted
the determination of the displacements in one dimension only,
<span class="pagenum">[62]</span><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>was in the end regarded as the more reliable method. With this
apparatus I could be more certain that the contacts were made
simultaneously, which was soon seen to be of the utmost importance
for these particular experiments. Then, too, by
means of this &aelig;sthesiometer, all movement of the points after
the contact was made was prevented. This also was an advantage
in the use of this apparatus, here and elsewhere, which
can hardly be overestimated. With any &aelig;sthesiometer that is operated
directly by the hand, it is impossible to avoid imparting a
slight motion to the points and thus changing altogether the
character of the impression. The importance of this consideration
for my work was brought forcibly to my attention in this
way. One of the results of these tests was that when two simultaneous
contacts are made differing in weight, if only one is
recognized it is invariably located in the region of the contact
with the heavier point. But now if, while the points were in
contact with the skin and before the judgment was pronounced,
I gave the lighter point a slight jar, its presence and location
were thereby revealed to the subject. Then, too, it was found
to be an advantage that the judgments were thus confined to the
longitudinal displacement only; for, as I have before insisted,
it was the relative, not the absolute position that I wished to
determine, since my object in all these experiments in localization
was to determine what connection, if any, exists between
judgments upon cutaneous distances made indirectly by means
of localization, and judgments that are pronounced directly
upon the subjective experience of the distance.</p>

<p>In the first of these experiments, in which two points of
different weight were used, the points were always taken safely
outside of the threshold for the discrimination between two
points in the particular region of the skin operated on. An
inspection of the results shown in Figs. 2 and 3 will indicate
the marked tendency of the heavier point to attract the lighter.
In Figs. 2 and 3 the heavy curves were plotted from judgments
where both heavy and light points were given together.
The dotted curve represents the localization of each point when
given alone. The height of the curves at any particular point
is determined by the number of times a contact was judged to
<span class="pagenum">[63]</span><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>be directly under that point. The fact that the curves are higher
over the heavy points shows that, when two points were taken
as one, this one was localized in the vicinity of the heavier point.
When points were near the threshold for any region, it will be
observed that the two points were attracted to each other. But
when the points were altogether outside the threshold, they
seemed strangely to have repelled each other. As this problem
lay somewhat away from my main interest here, I did not undertake
to investigate this peculiar fluctuation exhaustively. My
chief purpose was satisfied when I found that the lighter point
is displaced toward the heavier, in short distances. A further
explanation of these figures will be given in connection with
similar figures in the next section.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[64]</span><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>This attraction of the heavier for the lighter points is, I think,
a sufficient explanation for the variations in judgments upon filled
distances where changes are made in the place at which the
pressure is applied. I furthermore believe that an extension of
this principle offers an explanation for the underestimation of
cutaneous line-distances, which has been frequently reported
from various laboratories. Such a straight line gives a subjective
impression of being heavier at the center. I found that if
the line is slightly concave at the center, so as to give the ends
greater prominence and thereby leave the subjective impression
that the line is uniform throughout its entire length, the line will
be overestimated in comparison with a point distance. Out of
one hundred judgments on the relative length of two hard-rubber
lines of 5 cm. when pressed against the skin, one of which was
slightly concave, the concave line was overestimated eighty-four
times. For sight, a line in which the shaded part is concentrated
at the center appears longer than an objectively equal line
with the shading massed towards the ends.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>In the last section, I gave an account of some experiments
in the localization of touch sensations which were designed to
show how, under varying pressure, the points in the filled distance
are displaced or fused and disappear entirely from the judgment.
Our earliest experiments, it will be remembered, yielded unmistakable
evidence that short, filled distances were underestimated;
while all of the secondary experiments reported in the last section
have pointed to the conclusion that even these shorter distances
will follow the law of the longer distances and be overestimated
under certain objective conditions, which conditions
are also more nearly parallel with those which we find in the
<span class="pagenum">[65]</span><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>optical illusion. I wish now to give the results of another and
longer set of experiments in the localization of a manifold of
touch sensations as we find them in this same illusion for filled
space, by which I hope to prove a direct relation between the
function of localization and the spatial functioning proper.</p>

<p>These experiments were made with the same apparatus and
method that were used in the previous study in localization; but
instead of two points of different weights, four points of uniform
weight were employed. This series, therefore, will show from
quite another point of view that the fusion which takes place,
even where there is no difference in the weight, is a very significant
factor in judgments of distance on the skin.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="./images/076-fig4.png" width="600" height="217" alt="FIG. 4." title="" />
<p class="sccaption">Fig. 4.</p></div>

<p>I need hardly say that here, and in all my other experiments,
the subjects were kept as far as possible in complete ignorance
of the object of the experiment. This and the other recognized
laboratory precautions were carefully observed throughout this
work. Four distances were used, 4, 8, 12 and 16 cm. At
frequent intervals throughout the tests the contact was made
with only one of the points instead of four. In this way there
came to light again the interesting fact which we have already
seen in the last section, which is of great significance for my
theory&mdash;that the end points are located differently when given
alone than when they are presented simultaneously with the
other points. I give a graphic representation of the results
obtained from a large number of judgments in Figs. 4, 5 and
6. These experiments with filled spaces, like the earlier experiments,
were made on the volar side of the forearm beginning
near the wrist. In each distance four points were used, equally
distributed over the space. The shaded curve, as in the
<span class="pagenum">[66]</span><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>previous figures, represents the results of the attempts to localize
the points when all four were given simultaneously. In the
dotted curves, the end points were given alone. The height of
the curve at any place is determined by the number of times a
point was located immediately underneath that particular part
of the curve. In Fig. 4 the curve which was determined by the
localization of the four points when given simultaneously, shows
by its shape how the points appear massed towards the center.
In Fig. 5 the curve <i>AB</i> shows, by its crests at <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, that
the end points tended to free themselves from the rest in the
judgments. But if the distance <i>AB</i> be taken to represent the
average of the judgments upon the filled space 1, 2, 3, 4, it
will be seen to be shorter than what may be regarded as the
average of the judgments upon the corresponding open space,
namely, the distance <i>A'B'</i>, determined by the localizations of
the end points alone. The comparative regularity of the curve
indicates that the subject was unable to discriminate among the
points of the filling with any degree of certainty. The localizations
were scattered quite uniformly along the line. In these
short distances the subject often judged four points as two, or
even one.</p>

<div class="center">

<div class="center">
<img src="./images/077-fig6.png" width="600" height="147" alt="FIG. 6." title="" />
<p class="sccaption">Fig. 6.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[67]</span><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>Turning to Fig. 6, we notice that the tendency is now to
locate the end points in the filled distance outside of the localization
of these same points when given without the intermediate
points. It will also be seen from the irregularities in these two
longer curves that there is now a clear-cut tendency to single
out the individual points. The fact that the curves here are
again higher over point 4 simply signifies that at this, the wrist
end, the failure to discover the presence of the points was less
frequent than towards the elbow. But this does not disturb the
relation of the two series of judgments. As I have before said,
the first two sets of experiments described in Section II. showed
that the shorter filled distances are underestimated, while the
longer distances are overestimated, and that between the two
there is somewhat of an 'indifferent zone.' In those experiments
the judgments were made directly on the cutaneous distances
themselves. In the experiments the results of which are
plotted in these curves, the judgment of distances is indirectly
reached through the function of localization. But it will be
observed that the results are substantially the same. The longer
distances are overestimated and the shorter distances underestimated.
The curves in Figs. 4, 5 and 6 were plotted on the
combined results for two subjects. But before the combination
was made the two main tendencies which I have just mentioned
were observed to be the same for both subjects.</p>

<p>It will be remembered also that in these experiments, where
the judgment of distance was based directly on the cutaneous
impression, the underestimation of the short, filled distance was
lessened and even turned into an overestimation, by giving
greater distinctness to the end points, in allowing them to come in
contact with the skin just before or just after the filling. The
results here are again the same as before. The tendency to
underestimate is lessened by this device. Whenever, then, a
filled space is made up of points which are distinctly perceived
as discrete&mdash;and this is shown in the longer curves by the
comparative accuracy with which the points are located&mdash;these
spaces are overestimated.</p>

<p>In all of these experiments on localization, the judgments
were given with open eyes, by naming the visual points under
<span class="pagenum">[68]</span><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>which the tactual points seemed to lie. I have already spoken
of the other method which I also employed. This consisted in
marking points on paper which seemed to correspond in number
and position to the points on the skin. During this process the
eyes were kept closed. This may appear to be a very crude
way of getting at the illusion, but from a large number of judgments
which show a surprising consistency I received the
emphatic confirmation of my previous conclusion, that filled
spaces were overestimated. These experiments were valuable
also from the fact that here the cutaneous space was estimated
by the muscle sense, or active touch, as it is called.</p>

<p>In the experiments so far described the filling in of the closed
space was always made by means of stationary points. I shall
now give a brief account of some experiments which I regard as
very important for the theory that I shall advance later. Here
the filling was made by means of a point drawn over the skin
from one end of a two-point distance to the other.</p>

<p>These experiments were made on four different parts of the
skin&mdash;the forehead, the back of the hand, the abdomen, and the
leg between the knee and the thigh. I here forsook the plan
which I had followed almost exclusively hitherto, that of comparing
the cutaneous distances with each other directly. The
judgments now were secured indirectly through the medium of
visual distances. There was placed before the subject a gray
card, upon which were put a series of two-point distances ranging
from 2 to 20 cm. The two-point distances were given on
the skin, and the subject then selected from the optical distances
the one that appeared equal to the cutaneous distance. This
process furnished the judgments on open spaces. For the filled
spaces, immediately after the two-point distance was given a
blunt stylus was drawn from one point to the other, and the subject
then again selected the optical distance which seemed equal
to this distance filled by the moving point.</p>

<p>The results from these experiments point very plainly in one
direction. I have therefore thought it unnecessary to go into
any further detail with them than to state that for all subjects
and for all regions of the skin the filled spaces were overestimated.
This overestimation varied also with the rate of speed
<span class="pagenum">[69]</span><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>at which the stylus was moved. The overestimation is greatest
where the motion is slowest.</p>

<p>Vierordt<a name="FNanchor_7_32" id="FNanchor_7_32"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_7_32'>7</a> found the same result in his studies on the time
sense, that is, that the more rapid the movement, the shorter the
distance seems. But lines drawn on the skin are, according to
him, underestimated in comparison with open two-point distances.
Fechner<a name="FNanchor_8_33" id="FNanchor_8_33"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_8_33'>8</a> also reported that a line drawn on the skin is judged
shorter than the distance between two points which are merely
touched. It will be noticed, however, that my experiments differed
from those of Vierordt and Fechner in one essential respect.
This difference, I think, is sufficient to explain the different results.
In my experiments the two-point distance was held on the
skin, while the stylus was moved from one point to the other. In
their experiments the line was drawn without the points. This
of course changes the objective conditions. In simply drawing
a line on the skin the subject rapidly loses sight of the starting
point of the movement. It follows, as it were, the moving point,
and hence the entire distance is underestimated. I made a small
number of tests of this kind, and found that the line seemed
shorter than the point distance as Fechner and Vierordt declared.
But when the point distance is kept on the skin while the stylus
is being drawn, the filling is allowed its full effect in the judgment,
inasmuch as the end points are perceived as stationary
landmarks. The subjects at first found some difficulty in withholding
their judgments until the movement was completed.
Some subjects declared that they frequently made a preliminary
judgment before the filling was inserted, but that when the
moving point approached the end point, they had distinctly the
experience that the distance was widening. In these experiments
I used five sorts of motion, quick and heavy, quick and
light, slow and heavy, slow and light, and interrupted. I made
no attempt to determine either the exact amount of pressure or
the exact rate. I aimed simply at securing pronounced extremes.
The slow rate was approximately 3, and the fast approximately
15 cm. per second.</p>

<p>I have already said that these filled spaces were invariably
<span class="pagenum">[70]</span><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>overestimated and that the slower the movement, the greater, in
general, is the overestimation. In addition to the facts just
stated I found also, what Hall and Donaldson<a name="FNanchor_9_34" id="FNanchor_9_34"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_9_34'>9</a> discovered, that
an increase in the pressure of a moving point diminishes the
apparent distance.</p>

<p>Nichols,<a name="FNanchor_10_35" id="FNanchor_10_35"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_10_35'>10</a> however, says that heavy movements seem longer
and light ones shorter.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>


<p>There are several important matters which might properly
have been mentioned in an earlier part of this paper, in connection
with the experiments to which they relate, but which I
have designedly omitted, in order not to disturb the continuity
in the development of the central object of the research. The first
of these is the question of the influence of visualization on the
judgments of cutaneous distances. This is in many ways a
most important question, and confronts one who is making
studies in tactual space everywhere. The reader may have
already noticed that I have said but little about the factor of
visualization in any of my experiments, and may have regarded
it as a serious omission. It might be offered as a criticism of
my work that the fact that I found the tactual illusions to exist
in the same sense as the optical illusions was perhaps due to
the failure to exclude visualization. All of the subjects declare
that they were unable to shut out the influence of visualizing
entirely. Some of the subjects who were very good visualizers
found the habit especially insistent. I think, however, that not
even in these latter cases does this factor at all vitiate my conclusions.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the experiments up to this time
fall into two groups, first, those in which the judgments on the
cutaneous distances were reached by direct comparisons of the
sensations themselves; and secondly, those in which the sensations
were first localized and then the judgment of the distance
read from these localizations. Visualizing, therefore, entered
very differently into the two groups. In the first instance all
<span class="pagenum">[71]</span><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>of the judgments were made with the eyes closed, while all of
the localizations were made with the eyes open. I was uncertain
through the whole of the first group of experiments as
to just how much disturbance was being caused in the estimation
of the distance by visualizing. I therefore made a series
of experiments to determine what effect was produced upon the
illusion if in the one set of judgments one purposely visualized
and in the other excluded visualizing as far as possible. In
my own case I found that after some practice I could give very
consistent judgments, in which I felt that I had abstracted from
the visualized image of the arm almost entirely. I did not examine
these results until the close of the series, and then found
that the illusion was greater for those judgments in which
visualization was excluded; that is, the filled space seemed
much larger when the judgment was made without the help of
visualization. It is evident, therefore, that the tactual illusion
is influenced rather in a negative direction by visualization.</p>

<p>In the second group of experiments, where the judgments
were obtained through the localization of the points, it would
seem, at first sight, that the judgments must have been very
largely influenced by the direct vision used in localizing the
points. The subject, as will be remembered, looked down at
a card of numbered points and named those which were directly
over the contacts beneath. Here it should seem that the
optical illusion of the overestimation of filled spaces, filled with
points on the card, would be directly transmitted to the sensation
on the skin underneath. Such criticism on this method of getting
at the illusion has already been made orally to me. But
this is obviously a mistaken objection. The points on the card
make a filled space, which of course appears larger, but as the
points expand, the numbers which are attached to them expand
likewise, and the optical illusion has plainly no influence whatever
upon the tactual illusion.</p>

<p>A really serious objection to this indirect method of approaching
the illusion is, that the character of the cutaneous
sensation is never so distinctly perceived when the eyes are
open as when they are closed. Several subjects often found it
necessary to close their eyes first, in order to get a clear perception
<span class="pagenum">[72]</span><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>of the locality of the points; they then opened their
eyes, to name the visual points directly above. Some subjects
even complained that when they opened their eyes they lost
track of the exact location of the touch points, which they
seemed to have when their eyes were closed. The tactual impression
seems to be lost in the presence of active vision.</p>

<p>On the whole, then, I feel quite sure in concluding that the
overestimation of the filled cutaneous spaces is not traceable to
the influence of visualization. Parrish has explained all sporadic
cases of overestimation as due to the optical illusion carried
over in visualization. I have already shown that in my experiments
visualization has really the opposite effect. In Parrish's
experiments the overestimation occurred in the case of those
collections of points which were so arranged as to allow the
greatest differentiation among the points, and especially where
the end-points were more or less distinct from the rest. This,
according to my theory, is precisely what one would expect.</p>

<p>Those who have made quantitative studies in the optical
illusion, especially in this particular illusion for open and filled
spaces, have observed and commented on the instability of the
illusion. Auerbach<a name="FNanchor_11_36" id="FNanchor_11_36"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_11_36'>11</a> says, in his investigation of the quantitative
variations of the illusion, that concentration of attention
diminishes the illusion. In the Z&ouml;llner figure, for instance, I
have been able to notice the illusion fluctuate through a wide
range, without eye-movements and without definitely attending
to any point, during the fluctuation of the attention. My
experiments with the tactual illusion have led me to the conclusion
that it fluctuates even more than the optical illusion.
Any deliberation in the judgment causes the apparent size
of the filled space to shrink. The judgments that are given
most rapidly and na&iuml;vely exhibit the strongest tendency to
overestimation; and yet these judgments are so consistent as to
exclude them from the category of guesses.</p>

<p>In most of my experiments, however, I did not insist on
rapid and na&iuml;ve judgments; but by a close observation of the
subject as he was about to make a judgment I could tell quite
<span class="pagenum">[73]</span><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>plainly which judgments were spontaneous and which were
deliberate. By keeping track of these with a system of marks,
I was able to collect them in the end into groups representing
fairly well the different degrees of attention. The illusion is
always greatest for the group of spontaneous judgments, which
points to the conclusion that all illusions, tactual as well as
visual, are very largely a function of attention.</p>

<p>In Section II. I told of my attempt to reproduce the optical
illusion upon the skin in the same form in which we find it for
sight, namely, by presenting the open and filled spaces simultaneously,
so that they might be held in a unitary grasp of
consciousness and the judgment pronounced on the relative
length of these parts of a whole. However, as I have already
said, the filled space appears longer, not only when given simultaneously,
but also when given successively with the open
space. In the case of the optical illusion I am not so sure that
the illusion does not exist if the two spaces are not presented
simultaneously and adjacent, as M&uuml;nsterberg asserts.
Although, to be sure, for me the illusion is not so strong when
an interval is allowed between the two spaces, I was interested
to know whether this was true also in the case of a touch illusion.
My previous tables did not enable me to compare the
quantitative extent of the illusion for successive and simultaneous
presentation. But I found in two series which had this
point directly in view, one with the subject <i>F</i> and one in which
<i>G</i> served as subject, that the illusion was emphatically stronger
when the open and filled spaces were presented simultaneously
and adjacent. In this instance, the illusion was doubtless a
combination of two illusions&mdash;a shrinking of the open space,
on the one hand, and a lengthening of the filled space on the
other hand. Binet says, in his studies on the well-known
M&uuml;ller-Lyer illusion, that he believes the illusion, in its highest
effects at any rate, to be due to a double contrast illusion.</p>

<p>This distortion of contrasted distances I have found in more
than one case in this investigation&mdash;not only in the case of distances
in which there is a qualitative difference, but also in the
case of two open distances. In one experiment, in which open
distances on the skin were compared with optical point distances,
<span class="pagenum">[74]</span><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>a distance of 10 cm. was given fifty times in connection with a
distance of 15 cm., and fifty times in connection with a distance
of 5 cm. In the former instance the distance of 10 cm. was
underestimated, and in the other it was overestimated.</p>

<p>The general conclusion of the entire investigation thus far
may be summed up in the statement: <i>Wherever the objective
conditions are the same in the two senses, the illusion exists in
the same direction for both sight and touch.</i></p>

<h3>VI.</h3>


<p>Thus far all of my experiments were made with <i>passive</i>
touch. I intend now to pursue this problem of the relation between
the illusions of sight and touch into the region of <i>active</i>
touch. I have yielded somewhat to the current fashion in thus
separating the passive from the active touch in this discussion.
I have already said that I believe it would be better not to make
this distinction so pronounced. Here again I have concerned
myself primarily with only one illusion, the illusion which deals
with open and filled spaces. This is the illusion to which
Dresslar<a name="FNanchor_12_37" id="FNanchor_12_37"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_12_37'>12</a> devoted a considerable portion of his essay on the
'Psychology of Touch,' and which he erroneously thought to be
the counterpart of the optical illusion for open and filled spaces.
One of the earliest notices of this illusion is that given by
James,<a name="FNanchor_13_38" id="FNanchor_13_38"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_13_38'>13</a> who says, &quot;Divide a line on paper into two equal
halves, puncture the extremities, and make punctures all along
one of the halves; then, with the finger-tip on the opposite side
of the paper, follow the line of punctures; the empty half will
seem much longer than the punctured half.&quot;</p>

<p>James has given no detailed account of his experiments.
He does not tell us how many tests were made, nor how long
the lines were, nor whether the illusion was the same when the
open half was presented first. Dresslar took these important
questions into consideration, and arrived at a conclusion directly
opposite to that of James, namely, that the filled half of the line
appears larger than the open half. Dresslar's conclusion is,
therefore, that sight and touch function alike. I have already
<span class="pagenum">[75]</span><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>said that I think that Parrish was entirely right in saying that
this is not the analogue of the familiar optical illusion. Nevertheless,
I felt sure that it would be quite worth the while to
make a more extensive study than that which Dresslar has reported.
Others besides James and Dresslar have experimented
with this illusion. As in the case of the illusion for passive
touch, there are not wanting champions of both opinions as to
the direction in which this illusion lies.</p>

<p>I may say in advance of the account of my experiments,
that I have here also found a ground of reconciliation for these
two divergent opinions. Just as in the case of the illusion for
passive touch, there are here also certain conditions under
which the filled space seems longer, and other conditions
under which it appears shorter than the open space. I feel
warranted, therefore, in giving in some detail my research on
this illusion, which again has been an extended one. I think
that the results of this study are equally important with those
for passive touch, because of the further light which they throw
on the way in which our touch sense functions in the perception
of the geometrical illusions. Dresslar's experiments, like
those of James, were made with cards in which one half was
filled with punctures. The number of punctures in each centimeter
varied with the different cards. Dresslar's conclusion
was not only that the filled space is overestimated, but also that
the overestimation varies, in a general way, with the number of
punctures in the filling. Up to a certain point, the more holes
there are in the card, the longer the space appears.</p>

<p>I had at the onset of the present experiment the same feeling
about Dresslar's work that I had about Parrish's work, which I
have already criticised, namely, that a large number of experiments,
in which many variations were introduced, would bring
to light facts that would explain the variety of opinion that had
hitherto been expressed. I was confident, however, that what
was most needed was a quantitative determination of the illusion.
Then, too, inasmuch as the illusion, whatever direction it takes,
is certainly due to some sort of qualitative differences in the two
kinds of touch sensations, those from the punctured, and those
from the smooth half, it seemed especially desirable to introduce
<span class="pagenum">[76]</span><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>as many changes into the nature of the filling as possible. The
punctured cards I found very unsatisfactory, because they
rapidly wear off, and thus change the quality of the sensations,
even from judgment to judgment.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="./images/087-fig7.png" width="600" height="225" alt="FIG. 7." title="" />
<p class="sccaption">Fig. 7.</p></div>

<p>The first piece of apparatus that I used in the investigation
of the illusion for open and filled space with active touch is
shown in Fig. 7. A thimble <i>A</i>, in which the finger was carried,
moved freely along the rod <i>B</i>. The filled spaces were
produced by rows of tacks on the roller <i>C</i>. By turning the
roller, different kinds of fillings were brought into contact with
the finger-tip. The paper <i>D</i>, on which the judgments were
recorded by the subject, could be slowly advanced under the
roller <i>E</i>. Underneath the thimble carrier there was a pin so
arranged that, by a slight depression of the finger, a mark was
made on the record paper beneath. A typical judgment was
made as follows; the subject inserted his finger in the thimble,
slightly depressed the carrier to record the starting points, then
brought his finger-tip into contact with the first point in the filled
space. The subject was, of course, all the while ignorant of
the length or character of the filling over which he was about
to pass. The finger-tip was then drawn along the points, and
out over the smooth surface of the roller, until the open space
passed over was judged equal to the filled space. Another
slight depression of the finger registered the judgment on the
paper below. The paper was then moved forward by turning
the roller <i>E</i>, and, if desired, a different row of pins was put in
place for judgment by revolving the roller <i>C</i>. The dividing
line between the open and filled spaces was continuously recorded
<span class="pagenum">[77]</span><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>on the paper from below by a pin not shown in the illustration.</p>

<p>The rollers, of which I had three, were easily removed or
turned about, so that the open space was presented first. In
one of the distances on each roller both spaces were unfilled.
This was used at frequent intervals in each series and served
somewhat the same purpose as reversing the order in which the
open and filled spaces were presented. With some subjects this
was the only safe way of securing accurate results. The absolute
distances measured off were not always a sure criterion as
to whether the filled space was under-or overestimated. For
example, one rather erratic subject, who was, however, very
constant in his erratic judgments, as an average of fifty judgments
declared a filled space of 4 cm. to be equal to an open
space of 3.7 cm. This would seem, on the surface, to mean that
the filled space had been underestimated. But with these fifty
judgments there were alternated judgments on two open spaces,
in which the first open space was judged equal to the second
open space of 3.2 cm. From this it is obvious that the effect
of the filling was to cause an overestimation&mdash;not underestimation
as seemed at first sight to be the case.</p>

<p>In another instance, this same subject judged a filled space
of 12.0 cm. to be equal to an open space of 12.9 cm., which
would seem to indicate an overestimation of the filled space.
But an average of the judgments on two open spaces that were
given in alternation shows that an equivalence was set up
between the two at 13.7 cm. for the second open space. This
would show that the filling of a space really produced an underestimation.</p>

<p>The same results were obtained from other subjects. In
my experiments on the illusion for passive touch, I pointed out
that it is unsafe to draw any conclusion from a judgment of
comparison between open and filled cutaneous spaces, unless
we had previously determined what might be called a standard
judgment of comparison between two open spaces. The parts
of our muscular space are quite as unsymmetrical as the parts
of our skin space. The difficulties arising from this lack of
symmetry can best be eliminated by introducing at frequent intervals
<span class="pagenum">[78]</span><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>judgments on two open spaces. As I shall try to show
later, the psychological character of the judgment is entirely
changed by reversing the order in which the spaces are presented,
and we cannot in this way eliminate the errors due to
fluctuations of the attention.</p>

<p>The apparatus which I used in these first experiments possesses
several manifest advantages. Chief among these was
the rapidity with which large numbers of judgments could be
gathered and automatically recorded. Then, in long distances,
when the open space was presented first, the subject found no
difficulty in striking the first point of the filled space. Dresslar
mentioned this as one reason why in his experiments he could
not safely use long distances. His subjects complained of an
anxious straining of the attention in their efforts to meet the
first point of the filled space.</p>

<p>There are two defects manifest in this apparatus. In the
first place, the other tactual sensations that arise from contact
with the thimble and from the friction with the carrier moving
along the sliding rod cannot be disregarded as unimportant
factors in the judgments. Secondly, there is obviously a difference
between a judgment that is made by the subject's stopping
when he reaches a point which seems to him to measure off
equal spaces, and a judgment that is made by sweeping the
finger over a card, as in Dresslar's experiments, with a uniform
motion, and then, after the movement has ceased, pronouncing
judgment upon the relative lengths of the two spaces. In the
former case the subject moves his finger uniformly until he
approaches the region of equality, and then slackens his speed
and slowly comes to a standstill. This of course changes the
character of the judgments. Both of these defects I remedied
in another apparatus which will be described later. For my
present purpose I may disregard these objections, as they affect
alike all the judgments.</p>

<p>In making the tests for the first series, the subject removed
his finger after each judgment, so that the position of the
apparatus could be changed and the subject made to enter
upon the new judgment without knowing either the approximate
length or the nature of the filling of this new test. With
<span class="pagenum">[79]</span><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>this apparatus no attempt was made to discover the effects of
introducing changes in the rate of speed. The only requirement
was that the motion should be uniform. This does not
mean that I disregarded the factor of speed. On the contrary,
this <i>time</i> element I consider as of the highest consequence in
the whole of the present investigation. But I soon discovered,
in these experiments, that the subjects themselves varied the
rate of speed from judgment to judgment over a wide range of
rates. There was no difficulty in keeping track of these variations,
by recording the judgments under three groups, fast,
slow and medium. But I found that I could do this more conveniently
with another apparatus, and will tell at a later place
of the results of introducing a time element. In these first experiments
the subject was allowed to use any rate of speed
which was convenient to him.</p>

<p>First line reads: 'When the finger-tip was drawn over a filled distance of
2 cm., the subject <i>P</i> measured off 3.8 on the open surface, the subject <i>R</i> 3.6,
etc.' Each number is the average of five judgments. In Table IX. the points
were set at regular intervals. In Table X. the filling was made irregular by
having some points rougher than the others and set at different intervals.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[80]</span><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>I can give here only a very brief summary of the results with
this apparatus. In Tables IX. and X. I give a few of the figures
which will show the tendency of the experiments. In these
tests a different length and a different filling were given for
each judgment. The result of the experiments of this group
is, first, that the <i>shorter filled spaces are judged longer and
the longer spaces shorter</i> than they really were. Second,
that an increase in the number of points in the filled space
causes no perceptible change in the apparent length. Third,
that when the filling is so arranged as to produce a tactual
rhythm by changing the position or size of every third
point, the apparent length of the space is increased. It will be
noticed, also, that this is just the reverse of the result that was
obtained for passive touch. These facts, which were completely
borne out by several other experiments with different apparatus
which I shall describe later, furnish again a reason why different
investigators have hitherto reported the illusion to exist, now
in one direction, now in the other. Dresslar drew the conclusion
from his experiments that the filled spaces are always overestimated,
but at the same time his figures show an increasing
tendency towards an underestimation of the filled spaces as the
distances increased in length. I shall later, in connection with
similar results from other experiments on this illusion, endeavor
to explain these anomalous facts.</p>

<p>In section IV. I mentioned the fact that I found the illusion
for passive touch to be subject to large fluctuations. This is
true also of the illusion for active touch. When the finger-tip
is drawn over the filled, and then out over the open space, the
limits between which the stopping point varies is a much wider
range than when the finger-tip is drawn over two open spaces.
In the latter case I found the variation to follow Weber's Law
in a general way. At first I thought these erratic judgments
were mere guesses on the part of the subject; but I soon discovered
a certain consistency in the midst of these extreme
fluctuations. To show what I mean, I have plotted some diagrams
based on a few of the results for three subjects. These
diagrams are found in Fig. 8. It will be observed that the
curve which represents the collection of stopping points is
<span class="pagenum">[81]</span><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>shorter and higher where the judgments were on two open
spaces. This shows plainly a greater accuracy in the judgments
than when the judgments were on a filled and an open
space, where the curves are seen to be longer and flatter. This
fluctuation in the illusion becomes important in the theoretical
part of my discussion, and, at the risk of apparently emphasizing
unduly an insignificant matter, I have given in Fig. 9 an
exact copy of a sheet of judgments as it came from the
apparatus. This shows plainly how the illusion wears away
with practice, when one distance is given several times in succession.
The subject was allowed to give his judgment on
the same distance ten times before passing to another. A
glance at the diagram will show how pronounced the illusion is
at first, and how it then disappears, and the judgment settles
down to a uniform degree of accuracy. It will be seen that
the short filled space is at first overestimated, and then, with the
succeeding judgments, this overestimation is gradually reduced.
In the case of the longer filled distances (which could not be
conveniently reproduced here) the spaces were at first underestimated,
and then this underestimation slowly decreased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[82]</span><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>None of the qualitative studies that have hitherto been made
on this illusion have brought to light this significant wearing
away of the illusion.</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>


<p>I have already spoken of the defects of the apparatus with
which the experiments of the previous chapter were made. I
shall now give an account of some experiments that were made
with an apparatus designed to overcome these difficulties. This
is shown in Fig. 10. The block <i>C</i> was clamped to a table,
while the block <i>A</i> could be moved back and forth by the lever
<i>B</i>, in order to bring up different lengths of filled space for
judgment. For each judgment the subject brought his finger
back to the strip <i>D</i>, and by moving his finger up along the edge
of this strip he always came into contact with the first point of
the new distance. The lever was not used in the present experiment;
but in later experiments, where the points were moved
under the finger tip, which was held stationary, this lever was
very useful in producing different rates of speed. In one series
of experiments with this apparatus the filled spaces were presented
first, and in another series the open spaces were presented
first. In the previous experiments, so far as I have
reported them, the filled spaces were always presented first.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="./images/093-fig10.png" width="600" height="127" alt="Fig. 10." title="" />
<p class="sccaption">Fig. 10.</p></div>

<p>In order to enable the subject to make proper connections
with the first point in the filled space, when the open space was
presented first, a slight depression was put in the smooth surface.
This depression amounted merely to the suggestion of a groove,
but it sufficed to guide the finger.</p>

<p>The general results of the first series of experiments with this
apparatus were similar to those already given, but were based
on a very much larger number of judgments. They show at once
that the short filled spaces are overestimated, while the longer
<span class="pagenum">[83]</span><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>spaces are underestimated. The uniformity of this law has
seemed to me one of the most significant results of this entire
investigation. In the results already reported from the experiments
with the former apparatus, I have mentioned the fact
that the judgments upon the distances fluctuate more widely
when one is filled and the other open, than when both are open.
This fluctuation appeared again in a pronounced way in the
present experiments. I now set about to discover the cause of
this variation, which was so evidently outside of the limits of
Weber's law.</p>

<div class="tblexp"><p>The first line of group I. reads: 'When the finger-tip was passed over a filled
space of 2 cm., the subject <i>R</i> measured off 3.1 cm. on the open space, the subject
<i>B</i> 3.2 cm., and the subject <i>A</i> 3.7.' In group II., the numbers represent
the distance measured off when both spaces were unfilled.</p></div>

<p>In my search for the cause of the variations reported previously
I first tried the plan of obliging the subject to attend more
closely to the filled space as his finger was drawn over it. In
order to do this, I held a piece of fine wire across the line of the
filled space, and after the subject had measured off the equal
open space he was asked to tell whether or not he had crossed
<span class="pagenum">[84]</span><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>the wire. The wire was so fine that considerable attention was
necessary to detect it. In some of the experiments the wire
was inserted early in the filled space, and in some near the end.
When it was put in near the beginning, it was interesting to
notice, as illustrating the amount of attention that was being
given to the effort of finding the wire, that the subject, as soon
as he had discovered it, would increase his speed, relax the attention,
and continue the rest of the journey more easily.</p>

<p>The general effect of this forcing of the attention was to increase
the apparent length of the filled space. This conclusion
was reached by comparing these results with those in which there
was no compelled attention. When the obstacle was inserted
early, the space was judged shorter than when it came at the
end of the filled space. This shows very plainly the effect of
continued concentration of attention, when that attention is directed
intensely to the spot immediately under the finger-tip.
When the attention was focalized in this way, the subject lost
sight of the space as a whole. It rapidly faded out of memory
behind the moving finger-tip. But when this concentration of
attention was not required, the subject was able to hold together
in consciousness the entire collection of discrete points, and he
overestimated the space occupied by them. It must be remembered
here that I mean that the filled space with the focalized
attention was judged shorter than the filled space without such
concentration of attention, but both of these spaces were judged
shorter than the adjacent open space. This latter fact I shall
attempt to explain later. Many other simple devices were employed
to oblige the subject to fix his attention on the space as
it was traversed by the finger. The results were always the
same: the greater the amount of attention, the longer the distance
seemed.</p>

<p>In another experiment, I tried the plan of tapping a bell as
the subject was passing over the filled space and asking him,
after he had measured off the equivalent open space, whether
the sound had occurred in the first half or in the second half of
the filled space.</p>

<p>When the finger-tip was drawn over two adjacent open
spaces, and during the first a bell was tapped continuously, this
<span class="pagenum">[85]</span><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>kind of filled space was underestimated if the distance was long
and overestimated if the distance was short. So, too, if a disagreeable
odor was held to the nostrils while the finger-tip was
being drawn over one of the two adjacent open spaces, the
space thus filled by the sensations of smell followed the law
already stated. But if an agreeable perfume was used, the
distance always seemed shorter than when an unpleasant odor
was given.</p>

<p>In all of these experiments with spaces filled by means of
other than tactual sensations, I always compared the judgment
on the filled and open spaces with judgments on two open
spaces, in order to guard against any error due to unsymmetrical,
subjective conditions for the two spaces. It is difficult to have
the subject so seat himself before the apparatus as to avoid the
errors arising from tension and flexion. In one experiment, a
piece of plush was used for the filled space and the finger drawn
over it against the nap. This filled space was judged longer
than a piece of silk of equal length. The sensations from the
plush were very unpleasant. One subject said, even, that they
made him shudder. This was of course precisely what was
wanted for the experiment. It showed that the affective tone of
the sensation within the filled space was a most important factor
in producing an illusory judgment of distance.</p>

<p>The overestimation of these filled spaces is evidently due in
a large measure to &aelig;sthetic motives. The space that is filled
with agreeable sensations is judged shorter than one which is
filled with disagreeable sensations. In other words, the illusions
in judgments on cutaneous space are not so much dependent
on the quality of sensations that we get from the outer world
through these channels, as from the amount of inner activity
that we set over against these bare sense-perceptions.</p>

<p>I have already spoken of the defects of this method of
measuring off equivalent distances as a means of getting at the
quantitative amount of the illusion. The results that have
come to light thus far have, however, amply justified the
method. I had no difficulty, however, in adapting my apparatus
to the other way of getting the judgments. I had a short
curved piece of wire inserted in the handle, which could be
<span class="pagenum">[86]</span><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>held across the line traversed, and thus the end of the open
space could be marked out. Different lengths were presented
to the subject as before, but now the subject passed his finger
in a uniform motion over the spaces, after which he pronounced
the judgment 'greater,' 'equal,' or 'less.' The general result
of these experiments was not different from those already given.
The short, filled spaces were overestimated, while the longer
ones were underestimated. The only difference was found to
be that now the transition from one direction to the other was
at a more distant point. It was, of course, more difficult to
convert these qualitative results into a quantitative determination
of the illusion.</p>

<p>Before passing to the experiments in which the open spaces
were presented first, I wish to offer an explanation for the
divergent tendencies that were exhibited through all the experiments
of the last two sections, namely, that the short filled
spaces are overestimated and the long spaces underestimated.
Let us take two typical judgments, one in which a filled space
of 3 cm. is judged equal to an open space of 4.2 cm., and then
one in which the filled space is 9 cm., and is judged equal to
an open space of 7.4 cm. In the case of the shorter distance,
because of its shortness, after the finger leaves it, it is held in a
present state of consciousness for some moments, and does not
suffer the foreshortening that comes from pastness. This is,
however, only a part of the reason for its overestimation. After
the finger-tip has left the filled space, and while it is traversing
the first part of the open space, there is a dearth of sensations.
The tactual sensations are meager and faint, and muscular
tensions have not yet had time to arise. It is not until the
finger has passed over several centimeters of the distance, that
the surprise of its barrenness sets up the organic sensations of
muscular strain. One subject remarked na&iuml;vely at the end of
some experiments of this kind, that the process of judging was
an easy and comfortable affair so long as he was passing over
the filled space, but when he set out upon the open space he
had to pay far more strict attention to the experiment.</p>

<p>By a careful introspection of the processes in my own case,
I came to the conclusion that it is certainly a combination of
<span class="pagenum">[87]</span><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>these two illusions that causes the overestimation of the short
filled distances. In the case of the long distances, the underestimation
of the filled space is, I think, again due to a combination
of two illusions. When the finger-tip leaves the filled
space, part of it, because of its length, has already, as it were,
left the specious present, and has suffered the foreshortening
effect of being relegated to the past. And, on the other hand,
after the short distance of the open space has been traversed
the sensations of muscular strain become very pronounced, and
cause a premature judgment of equality.</p>

<p>One subject, who was very accurate in his judgments, and
for whom the illusion hardly existed, said, when asked to explain
his method of judging, that after leaving the filled space
he exerted a little more pressure with his finger as he passed
over the open space, so as to get the same quantity of tactual
sensations in both instances. The muscular tension that was
set up when the subject had passed out over the open space a
short way was very plainly noticeable in some subjects, who were
seen at this time to hold their breath.</p>

<p>I have thus far continually spoken of the space containing
the tacks as being the filled space, and the smooth surface as
the open space. But now we see that in reality the name should
be reversed, especially for the longer distances. The smooth
surface is, after the first few centimeters, very emphatically
filled with sensations arising from the organism which, as I have
already intimated, are of the most vital importance in our
spatial judgments. Now, according to the most generally
accepted psychological theories, it is these organic sensations
which are the means whereby we measure time, and our
spatial judgments are, in the last analysis, I will not for the
present say dependent on, but at any rate fundamentally related
to our time judgments.</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>


<p>In the last section I attempted to explain the overestimation
of short filled spaces, and the underestimation of long filled
spaces by active touch, as the result of a double illusion arising
from the differences in the manner and amount of attention
<span class="pagenum">[88]</span><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>given to the two kinds of spaces when they are held in immediate
contrast. This explanation was of course purely
theoretical. I have thus far offered no experiments to show
that this double illusion of lengthening, on the one hand, and
shortening, on the other, does actually exist. I next made some
simple experiments which seemed to prove conclusively that
the phenomenon does not exist, or at least not in so important a
way, when the time factor is not permitted to enter.</p>

<p>In these new experiments the filled and the open spaces
were compared separately with optical distances. After the
finger-tip was drawn over the filled path, judgment was given
on it at once by comparing it directly with an optical distance.
In this way the foreshortening effect of time was excluded.
In all these experiments it was seen that the filled space was
judged longer when the judgment was pronounced on it at once
than when an interval of time was allowed, either by drawing
the finger-tip out over the open space, as in the previous experiment,
or by requiring the subject to withhold his judgment until
a certain signal was given. Any postponement of the judgment
resulted in the disappearance of a certain amount of the
illusion. The judgments that were made rapidly and without
deliberation were subject to the strongest illusion. I have
already spoken of the unanimous testimony which all who have
made quantitative studies in the corresponding optical illusions
have given in this matter of the diminution of the illusion with
the lapse of time. The judgments that were made without
deliberation always exhibited the strongest tendency to illusion.</p>

<p>I have already said that the illusion for passive touch was
greatest when the two spaces were presented simultaneously
and adjacent. Dresslar has mentioned in his studies on the
'Psychology of Touch,' that the time factor cannot enter into
an explanation of this illusion; but the experiments of which I
have just spoken seem to point plainly to a very intimate relation
between this illusion and the illusions in our judgments of
time. We have here presented on a diminutive scale the
illusions which we see in our daily experience in comparing
past with present stretches of time. It is a well-known psychological
experience that a filled time appears short in passing,
<span class="pagenum">[89]</span><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>but long in retrospect, while an empty time appears long in
passing, but short in retrospect. Now this illusion of the open
and filled space, for the finger-tip, is at every point similar to
the illusion to which our time judgment is subject. If we pronounce
judgment on a filled space or filled time while we are
still actually living in it, it seems shorter than it really is,
because, while we pay attention to the discrete sensations of
external origin, we lose sight of the sensations of internal origin,
which are the sole means whereby we measure lapse of time,
and we consequently underestimate such stretches of time or
space. But when the sensations from the outer world which
enter into such filled spaces or times exist only in memory, the
time-measuring sensations of internal origin are allowed their
full effect; and such spaces and times seem much longer than
when we are actually passing through them.</p>

<p>I dwell on this illusion at a length which may seem out of
proportion to its importance. My object has been to show how
widely different are the objective conditions here from what
they are in the optical illusion which has so often been called
the analogue of this. James<a name="FNanchor_14_39" id="FNanchor_14_39"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_14_39'>14</a> has said of this tactual illusion:
'This seems to bring things back to the unanalyzable laws, by
reason of which our feeling of size is determined differently in
the skin and in the retina even when the objective conditions
are the same.' I think that my experiments have shown that
the objective conditions are not the same; that they differ in
that most essential of all factors, namely, the time element.
Something very nearly the analogue of the optical illusion is
secured when we take very short open and filled tactual spaces,
and move over them very rapidly. Here the illusion exists in
the same direction as it does for sight, as has already been
stated. On the other hand, a phenomenon more nearly parallel
to the tactual illusion, as reported in the experiments of James
and Dresslar, is found if we take long optical distances, and
traverse the open and filled spaces continuously, without having
both parts of the line entirely in the field of view at any one
moment. I made a few experiments with the optical illusion in
this form. The filled and open spaces were viewed by the subject
<span class="pagenum">[90]</span><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>through a slot which was passed over them. These experiments
all pointed in the direction of an underestimation of a
filled space. Everywhere in this illusion, then, where the objective
conditions were at all similar for sight and touch, the
resulting illusion exists in the same direction for both senses.</p>

<p>Throughout the previous experiments with the illusion for
active touch we saw the direct influence of the factor of time.
I have yet one set of experiments to report, which seems to me
to prove beyond the possibility of a doubt the correctness of my
position. These experiments were made with the apparatus
shown in Fig. 10. The subjects proceeded precisely as before.
The finger-tip was passed over the filled space, and then out
over the open space, until an equivalent distance was measured
off. But while the subject was drawing his fingers over the
spaces, the block <i>A</i> was moved in either direction by means of
the lever <i>B</i>. The subjects were all the while kept ignorant of
the fact that the block was being moved. They all expressed
great surprise on being told, after the experiments were over,
that the block had been moved under the finger-tip through
such long distances without their being able to detect it. The
block always remained stationary as the finger passed over one
space, but was moved either with or against the finger as it
passed over the other space.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[91]</span><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>I have given some of the results for one subject in Table
XII. These results show at a glance how potent a factor the
time element is. The quantity of tactual sensations received
by the finger-tip enters into the judgment of space to no appreciable
extent. With one subject, after he had passed his finger
over a filled space of 10 cm. the block was moved so as almost
to keep pace with the finger as it passed over the open space.
In this way the subject was forced to judge a filled space of 10
cm. equal to only 2 cm. of the open space. And when the
block was moved in the opposite direction he was made to judge
a distance of 10 cm. equal to an open distance of 16 cm.</p>

<p>The criticism may be made on these experiments that the
subject has not in reality been obliged to rely entirely upon the
time sense, but that he has equated the two spaces as the basis
of equivalent muscle or joint sensation, which might be considered
independent of the sensations which yield the notion of
time. I made some experiments, however, to prove that this
criticism would not be well founded. By arranging the apparatus
so that the finger-tip could be held stationary, and the block
with the open and filled spaces moved back and forth under it,
the measurement by joint and muscle sensations was eliminated.</p>

<p>It will be observed that no uniform motion could be secured
by simply manipulating the lever with the hand. But uniformity
of motion was not necessary for the results at which I aimed
here. Dresslar has laid great stress on the desirability of having
uniform motion in his similar experiments. But this, it seems
to me, is precisely what is not wanted. With my apparatus, I
was able to give widely different rates of speed to the block as
it passed under the finger-tip. By giving a slow rate for the
filled space and a much more rapid rate for the open space, I
found again that the subject relied hardly at all on the touch
sensations that came from the finger-tip, but almost entirely on
the consciousness of the amount of time consumed in passing
over the spaces. The judgments were made as in the previous
experiments with this apparatus. When the subject reached
the point in the open space which he judged equal to the filled
space, he slightly depressed his finger and stopped the moving
block. In this way, the subject was deprived of any assistance
<span class="pagenum">[92]</span><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>from arm-movements in his judgments, and was obliged to rely
on the tactual impressions received at the finger-tip, or on his
time sense. That these tactual sensations played here also a
very minor part in the judgment of the distance was shown by
the fact that these sensations could be doubled or trebled by
doubling or trebling the amount of space traversed, without
perceptibly changing the judgment, provided the rate of speed was
increased proportionately. Spaces that required the same
amount of time in traversing were judged equal.</p>

<p>In all these experiments the filled space was presented first.
When the open space was presented first, the results for four
out of five subjects were just reversed. For short distances the
filled space was underestimated, for long distances the filled
space was overestimated. A very plausible explanation for
these anomalous results is again to be found in the influence of
the time factor. The open space seemed longer while it was
being traversed, but rapidly foreshortened after it was left for
the filled space. While on the other hand, if the judgment was
pronounced while the subject was still in the midst of the filled
space, it seemed shorter than it really was. The combination
of these two illusions is plainly again responsible for the
underestimation of the short filled spaces. The same double illusion
may be taken to explain the opposite tendency for the longer
distances.</p>

<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>The one generalization that I have thus far drawn from the
investigation&mdash;namely, that the optical illusions are not reversed
in passing from the field of touch, and that we therefore have a
safe warrant for the conclusion that sight and touch do function
alike&mdash;has contained no implicit or expressed assertion as to
the origin of our notion of space. I have now reached the point
where I must venture an explanation of the illusion itself.</p>

<p>The favorite hypothesis for the explanation of the geometrical
optical illusions is the movement theory. The most
generally accepted explanation of the illusion with whose tactual
counterpart this paper is concerned, is that given by
Wundt.<a name="FNanchor_15_40" id="FNanchor_15_40"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_15_40'>15</a> Wundt's explanation rests on variation in eye movements.<span class="pagenum">[93]</span><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>
When the eye passes over broken distances, the movement
is made more difficult by reason of the frequent stoppages.
The fact that the space which is filled with only one point in
the middle is underestimated, is explained by Wundt on the
theory that the eye has here the tendency to fix on the middle
point and to estimate the distance by taking in the whole space
at once without moving from this middle point. A different
explanation for this illusion is offered by Helmholtz.<a name="FNanchor_16_41" id="FNanchor_16_41"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_16_41'>16</a> He
makes use of the &aelig;sthetic factor of contrasts. Wundt insists
that the fact that this illusion is still present when there are no
actual eye movements does not demonstrate that the illusion is
not to be referred to a motor origin. He says, &quot;If a phenomenon
is perceived with the moving eye only, the influence of
movement on it is undoubtedly true. But an inference cannot
be drawn in the opposite direction, that movement is without
influence on the phenomenon that persists when there is no
movement.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_17_42" id="FNanchor_17_42"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_17_42'>17</a></p>

<p>Satisfactorily as the movement hypothesis explains this and
other optical illusions, it yet falls short of furnishing an entirely
adequate explanation. It seems to me certain that several
causes exist to produce this illusion, and also the illusion that is
often associated with it, the well-known M&uuml;ller-Lyer illusion.
But in what degree each is present has not yet been determined
by any of the quantitative studies in this particular illusion. I
made a number of tests of the optical illusion, with these results:
that the illusion is strongest when the attention is fixed at about
the middle of the open space, that there is scarcely any illusion
left when the attention is fixed on the middle of the filled space.
It is stronger when the outer end-point of the open space is
fixated than when the outer end of the filled space is fixated.
For the moving eye, I find the illusion to be much stronger
when the eye passes over the filled space first, and then over
the open space, than when the process is reversed.</p>

<p>Now, the movement hypothesis does not, it seems to me,
sufficiently explain all the fluctuations in the illusion. My experiments
<span class="pagenum">[94]</span><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>with the tactual illusion justify the belief that the
movement theory is even less adequate to explain all of the variations
there, unless the movement hypothesis is given a wider
and richer interpretation than is ordinarily given to it. In the
explanation of the tactual illusion which I have here been studying
two other important factors must be taken into consideration.
These I shall call, for the sake of convenience, the &aelig;sthetic
factor and the time factor. These factors should not, however,
be regarded as independent of the factor of movement. That
term should be made wide enough to include these within its
meaning. The importance of the time factor in the illusion for
passive touch I have already briefly mentioned. I have also,
in several places in the course of my experiments, called attention
to the importance of the &aelig;sthetic element in our space
judgments. I wish now to consider these two factors more in
detail.</p>

<p>The foregoing discussion has pointed to the view that
the space-perceiving and the localizing functions of the skin
have a deep-lying common origin in the motor sensations.
My experiments show that, even in the highly differentiated
form in which we find them in their ordinary functioning,
they plainly reveal their common origin. A formula,
then, for expressing the judgments of distance by means
of the resting skin might be put in this way. Let <i>P</i> and <i>P'</i>
represent any two points on the skin, and let <i>L</i> and <i>L'</i> represent
the local signs of these points, and <i>M</i> and <i>M'</i> the muscle
sensations which give rise to these local signs. Then <i>M-M'</i> will
represent the distance between <i>P</i> and <i>P'</i>, whether that distance
be judged directly in terms of the localizing function of
the skin or in terms of its space-perceiving function. This
would be the formula for a normal judgment. In an illusory
judgment, the temporal and &aelig;sthetic factors enter as disturbing
elements. Now, the point which I insist on here is that the
judgments of the extent of the voluntary movements, represented
in the formula by <i>M</i> and <i>M'</i>, do not depend alone on
the sensations from the moving parts or other sensations of objective
origin, as Dresslar would say, nor alone on the intention
or impulse or innervation as Loeb and others claim, but on the
<span class="pagenum">[95]</span><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>sum of all the sensory elements that enter, both those of external
and those of internal origin. And, furthermore, these
sensations of external origin are important in judgments of
space, only in so far as they are referred to sensations of internal
origin. Delabarre says, &quot;Movements are judged equal
when their sensory elements are judged equal. These sensory
elements need not all have their source in the moving parts.
All sensations which are added from other parts of the body
and which are not recognized as coming from these distant
sources, are mingled with the elements from the moving member,
and influence the judgment.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_18_43" id="FNanchor_18_43"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_18_43'>18</a> The importance of these
sensations of inner origin was shown in many of the experiments
in sections VI. to VIII. In the instance where the finger-tip
was drawn over an open and a filled space, in the filled half
the sensations were largely of external origin, while in the
open half they were of internal origin. The result was that
the spaces filled with sensations of internal origin were always
overestimated.</p>

<p>The failure to recognize the importance of these inwardly
initiated sensations is the chief defect in Dresslar's reasoning.
He has endeavored to make our judgments in the illusion in
question depend entirely on the sensations of external origin.
He insists also that the illusion varies according to the variations
in quantity of these external sensations. Now my experiments
have shown, I think, very clearly that it is not the numerical
or quantitative extent of the objective sensations which
disturbs the judgment of distance, but the sensation of inner
origin which we set over against these outer sensations. The
piece of plush, because of the disagreeable sensations which it
gives, is judged shorter than the space filled with closely
crowded tacks. Dresslar seems to have overlooked entirely the
fact that the feelings and emotions can be sources of illusions
in the amount of movement, and hence in our judgments of
space. The importance of this element has been pointed out by
M&uuml;nsterberg<a name="FNanchor_19_44" id="FNanchor_19_44"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_19_44'>19</a> in his studies of movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[96]</span><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>Dresslar says again, &quot;The explanations heretofore given,
wholly based on the differences in the time the eye uses in
passing over the two spaces, must stop short of the real truth.&quot;
My experiments, however, as I have already indicated, go to
prove quite the contrary. In short, I do not think we have any
means of distinguishing our tactual judgments of time from our
similar judgments of space. When the subject is asked to
measure off equal spaces, he certainly uses time as means,
because when he is asked to measure off equal times he registers
precisely the same illusion that he makes in his judgments
of spatial distances. The fact that objectively equal times were
used by Dresslar in his experiments is no reason for supposing
that the subject also regarded these times as equal. What I
have here asserted of active touch is true also of the resting
skin. When a stylus is drawn over the skin, the subject's
answer to the question, How long is the distance? is subject to
precisely the same illusion as his answer to the question, How
long is the time?</p>

<p>I can by a simple illustration show more plainly what I
mean by the statement that the blending of the inner and outer
sensations is necessary for the perception of space. I shall use
the sense of sight for the illustration, although precisely the
same reasoning would apply to the sense of touch. Suppose
that I sat in an entirely passive position and gazed at a spot on
an otherwise blank piece of paper before me. I am perfectly
passive so far as motion on my part is concerned. I may be
engaged in any manner of speculation or be in the midst of the
so-called active attention to the spot; but I must be and for the
present remain motionless. Now, while I am in this condition
of passivity, suppose the spot be made to move slowly to one
side by some force external to myself. I am immovable all the
while, and yet am conscious of this movement of the spot from
the first position, which I call <i>A</i>, to the new position, <i>A'</i>, where
it stops. The sensation which I now have is qualitatively different
from the sensation which I had from the spot in its original
position. My world of experience thus far has been a
purely qualitative one. I might go on to eternity having experiences
of the same kind, and never dream of space, or geometry,
<span class="pagenum">[97]</span><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>nor should I have the unique experience of a geometrical
illusion, either optical or tactual. Now suppose I set up the
bodily movements of the eyes or the head, or of the whole
body, which are necessary to follow the path of that point, until
I overtake it and once more restore the quality of the original
sensation. This circle, completed by the two processes of
external activity and restoration by internal activity, forms a
group of sensations which constitutes the ultimate atom in our
spatial experience. I have my first spatial experience when I
have the thrill of satisfaction that comes from overtaking again,
by means of my own inner activity, a sensation that has escaped
me through an activity not my own. A being incapable of
motion, in a world of flux, would not have the spatial experience
that we have. A being incapable of motion could not
make the distinction between an outer change that can be corrected
by an internal change, and an outer change that cannot
so be restored. Such an external change incapable of restoration
by internal activity we should have if the spot on the paper
changed by a chemical process from black to red.</p>

<p>Now such a space theory is plainly not to be confused with
the theory that makes the reversibility of the spatial series its
primary property. It is evident that we can have a series of sensations
which may be reversed and yet not give the notion of
space. But we should always have space-perception if one half
of the circular process above described comes from an outer
activity, and the other half from an inner activity. This way of
describing the reversibility of the spatial series makes it less possible
to urge against it the objections that Stumpf<a name="FNanchor_20_45" id="FNanchor_20_45"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_20_45'>20</a> has formulated
against Bain's genetic space-theory. Stumpf's famous criticism
applies not only to Bain, but also to the other English empiricists
and to Wundt. Bain says: &quot;When with the hand we
grasp something moving and move with it, we have a sensation
of one unchanged contact and pressure, and the sensation is
imbedded in a movement. This is one experience. When we
move the hand over a fixed surface, we have with the feelings
of movement a succession of feelings of touch; if the surface is
<span class="pagenum">[98]</span><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>a variable one, the sensations are constantly changing, so that
we can be under no mistake as to our passing through a series
of tactual impressions. This is another experience, and differs
from the first not in the sense of power, but in the tactile accompaniment.
The difference, however, is of vital importance.
In the one case, we have an object moving and measuring time
and continuous, in the other case we have co&euml;xistence in
space. The co&euml;xistence is still further made apparent by our
reversing the movement, and thereby meeting the tactile series
in the inverse order. Moreover, the serial order is unchanged
by the rapidity of our movements.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_21_46" id="FNanchor_21_46"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_21_46'>21</a></p>

<p>Stumpf maintained in his exhaustive criticism of this theory,
first, that there are cases where all of the elements which Bain
requires for the perception of space are present, and yet we
have no presentation of space. Secondly, there are cases where
not all of these elements are present, and where we have nevertheless
space presentation. It is the first objection that concerns
me here. Stumpf gives as an example, under his first objection,
the singing of a series of tones, C, G, E, F. We have
here the muscle sensations from the larynx, and the series of
the tone-sensations which are, Stumpf claims, reversed when
the muscle-sensations are reversed, etc. According to Stumpf,
these are all the elements that are required by Bain, and yet we
have no perception of space thereby. Henri<a name="FNanchor_22_47" id="FNanchor_22_47"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_22_47'>22</a> has pointed out
two objections to Stumpf's criticism of Bain's theory. He says
that Bain assumes, what Stumpf does not recognize, that the
muscle sensations must contain three elements&mdash;resistance,
time, and velocity&mdash;before they can lead to space perceptions.
These three elements are not to be found in the muscle sensations
of the larynx as we find them in the sensations that come
from the eye or arm muscles. In addition to this, Henri claims
that Bain's theory demands a still further condition. If we
wish to touch two objects, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, with the same member, we
can get a spatial experience from the process only if we insert
between the touching of <i>A</i> and the touching of <i>B</i> a continual
<span class="pagenum">[99]</span><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>series of tactual sensations. In Stumpf's instance of the singing
of tones, this has been overlooked. We can go from the
tone C to the tone F without inserting between the two a continuous
series of musical sensations.</p>

<p>I think that all such objections to the genetic space theories
are avoided by formulating a theory in the manner in which I
have just stated. When one says that there must be an outer
activity producing a displacement of sensation, and then an
inner activity retaining that sensation, it is plain that the singing
of a series of tones ascending and then descending would not
be a case in point.</p>

<h2><a name="PER3" id="PER3"></a>TACTUAL TIME ESTIMATION.</h2>

<h4>BY KNIGHT DUNLAP.</h4>


<h3>I. GENERAL NATURE OF THE WORK.</h3>


<p>The experiments comprised in this investigation were made
during the year 1900-1901 and the early part of the year 1901-1902.
They were planned as the beginning of an attempt at
the analysis of the estimation of time intervals defined by tactual
stimulations. The only published work in this quarter of the
field so far is that of Vierordt,<a name="FNanchor_1_48" id="FNanchor_1_48"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_1_48'>1</a> who investigated only the constant
error of time judgment, using both auditory and tactual
stimulations, and that of Meumann,<a name="FNanchor_2_49" id="FNanchor_2_49"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_2_49'>2</a> who in his last published
contribution to the literature of the time sense gives the results
of his experiments with 'filled' and 'empty' tactual intervals.
The stimuli employed by Meumann were, however, not purely
tactual, but electrical.</p>

<p>The limitation of time intervals by tactual stimulations offers,
however, a rich field of variations, which promise assistance in
the analytical problem of the psychology of time. The variations
may be those of locality, area, intensity, rigidity, form,
consecutiveness, and so on, in addition to the old comparisons
of filled and empty intervals, intervals of varying length, and
intervals separated by a pause and those not so separated.</p>

<p>To begin with, we have selected the conditions which are
mechanically the simplest, namely, the comparison of two
empty time intervals, both given objectively with no pause between
them. We have employed the most easily accessible
dermal areas, namely, that of the fingers of one or both hands,
<span class="pagenum">[102]</span><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>and introduced the mechanically simplest variations, namely,
in locality stimulated and intensity of stimulation.</p>

<p>It was known from the results of nearly all who have studied
the time sense experimentally, that there is in general a constant
error of over- or underestimation of time intervals of moderate
length, and from the results of Meumann,<a name="FNanchor_3_50" id="FNanchor_3_50"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_3_50'>3</a> that variations in
intensity of limiting stimulation influenced the estimation decidedly,
but apparently according to no exact law. The problem
first at hand was then to see if variations introduced in tactual
stimulations produce any regularity of effect, and if they throw
any new light on the phenomena of the constant error.</p>

<p>The stimulations employed were light blows from the cork
tip of a hammer actuated by an electric current. These instruments,
of which there were two, exactly alike in construction,
were similar in principle to the acoustical hammers employed
by Estel and Mehner. Each consisted essentially of a lever
about ten inches in length, pivoted near one extremity, and having
fastened to it near the pivot an armature so acted upon by
an electromagnet as to depress the lever during the passage of
an electric current. The lever was returned to its original position
by a spring as soon as the current through the electromagnet
ceased. A clamp at the farther extremity held a small
wooden rod with a cork tip, at right angles to the pivot, and
the depression of the lever brought this tip into contact with the
dermal surface in proximity with which it had been placed.
The rod was easily removable, so that one bearing a different
tip could be substituted when desired. The whole instrument
was mounted on a compact base attached to a short rod, by
which it could be fastened in any desired position in an ordinary
laboratory clamp.</p>

<p>During the course of most of the experiments the current
was controlled by a pendulum beating half seconds and making
a mercury contact at the lowest point of its arc. A condenser
in parallel with the contact obviated the spark and consequent
noise of the current interruption. A key, inserted in the circuit
through the mercury cup and tapping instrument, allowed it to
<span class="pagenum">[103]</span><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>be opened or closed as desired, so that an interval of any
number of half seconds could be interposed between successive
stimulations.</p>

<p>In the first work, a modification of the method of right and
wrong cases was followed, and found satisfactory. A series
of intervals, ranging from one which was on the whole distinctly
perceptible as longer than the standard to one on the whole distinctly
shorter, was represented by a series of cards. Two
such series were shuffled together, and the intervals given in
the order so determined. Thus, when the pile of cards had
been gone through, two complete series had been given, but in
an order which the subject was confident was perfectly irregular.
As he also knew that in a given series there were more than
one occurrence of each compared interval (he was not informed
that there were exactly two of each), every possible influence
favored the formation each time of a perfectly fresh judgment
without reference to preceding judgments. The only fear was
lest certain sequences of compared intervals (<i>e.g.</i>, a long compared
interval in one test followed by a short one in the next),
might produce unreliable results; but careful examination of
the data, in which the order of the interval was always noted,
fails to show any influence of such a factor.</p>

<p>To be more explicit with regard to the conditions of judgment;
two intervals were presented to the subject in immediate
succession. That is, the second stimulation marked the end of
the first interval and the beginning of the second. The first
interval was always the standard, while the second, or compared
interval, varied in length, as determined by the series of cards,
and the subject was requested to judge whether it was equal to,
or longer or shorter than the standard interval.</p>

<p>In all of the work under Group 1, and the first work under
Group 2, the standard interval employed was 5.0 seconds.
This interval was selected because the minimum variation possible
with the pendulum apparatus (1/2 sec.) was too great for
the satisfactory operation of a shorter standard, and it was not
deemed advisable to keep the subject's attention on the strain for
a longer interval, since 5.0 sec. satisfied all the requirements of
the experiment.<span class="pagenum">[104]</span><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></p>

<p>In all work here reported, the cork tip on the tapping instrument
was circular in form, and 1 mm. in diameter. In all,
except one experiment of the second group, the areas stimulated
were on the backs of the fingers, just above the nails.
In the one exception a spot on the forearm was used in conjunction
with the middle finger.</p>

<p>In Groups 1 and 2 the intensity of stroke used was just sufficient
to give a sharp and distinct stimulation. The intensity of
the stimulation was not of a high degree of constancy from day
to day, on account of variations in the electric contacts, but
within each test of three stimulations the intensity was constant
enough.</p>

<p>In experiments under Group 3 two intensities of strokes were
employed, one somewhat stronger than the stroke employed in
the other experiments, and one somewhat weaker&mdash;just strong
enough to be perceived easily. The introduction of the two
into the same test was effected by the use of an auxiliary loop
in the circuit, containing a rheostat, so that the depression of the
first key completed the circuit as usual, or the second key completed
it through the rheostat.</p>

<p>At each test the subject was warned to prepare for the first
stimulation by a signal preceding it at an exact interval. In
experiments with the pendulum apparatus the signal was the
spoken word 'now,' and the preparatory interval one second.
Later, experiments were undertaken with preparatory intervals
of one second and 1-4/5 seconds, to find if the estimation differed
perceptibly in one case from that in the other. No difference
was found, and in work thereafter each subject was allowed the
preparatory interval which made the conditions subjectively
most satisfactory to him.</p>

<p>Ample time for rest was allowed the subject after each test
in a series, two (sometimes three) series of twenty to twenty-four
tests being all that were usually taken in the course of the hour.
Attention to the interval was not especially fatiguing and was
sustained without difficulty after a few trials.</p>

<p>Further details will be treated as they come up in the consideration
of the work by groups, into which the experiment naturally
falls.<span class="pagenum">[105]</span><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></p>


<h3>II. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS.</h3>


<p>1. The first group of experiments was undertaken to find the
direction of the constant error for the 5.0 sec. standard, the extent
to which different subjects agree and the effects of practice.
The tests were therefore made with three taps of equal intensity
on a single dermal area. The subject sat in a comfortable position
before a table upon which his arm rested. His hand lay
palm down on a felt cushion and the tapping instrument was
adjusted immediately over it, in position to stimulate a spot on
the back of the finger, just above the nail. A few tests were
given on the first finger and a few on the second alternately
throughout the experiments, in order to avoid the numbing
effect of continual tapping on one spot. The records for each
of the two fingers were however kept separately and showed
no disagreement.</p>

<p>The detailed results for one subject (<i>Mr</i>,) are given in
Table I. The first column, under <i>CT</i>, gives the values of
the different compared intervals employed. The next three
columns, under <i>S</i>, <i>E</i> and <i>L</i>, give the number of judgments of
<i>shorter</i>, <i>equal</i> and <i>longer</i>, respectively. The fifth column,
under <i>W</i>, gives the number of errors for each compared interval,
the judgments of <i>equal</i> being divided equally between
the categories of <i>longer</i> and <i>shorter</i>.</p>

<p>In all the succeeding discussion the standard interval will
be represented by <i>ST</i>, the compared interval by <i>CT</i>. <i>ET</i> is
that <i>CT</i> which the subject judges equal to <i>ST</i>.</p>

<h5>TABLE I.</h5>

<p class="tbltitle"><i>ST</i>=5.0 SEC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SUBJECT <i>Mr</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 60 SERIES.</p>

<div class="center"><table summary="TABLE I">
<colgroup span="5"><col align="left" width="70px" /><col span="4" align="right" width="50px" /></colgroup>
<tr><th><i>CT</i></th><th><i>S</i></th><th><i>E</i></th><th><i>L</i></th><th><i>W</i></th></tr>
<tr><td>4.</td><td>58</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1.5</td></tr>
<tr><td>4.5</td><td>45</td><td>11</td><td>4</td><td>9.5</td></tr>
<tr><td>5.</td><td>32</td><td>13</td><td>15</td><td>21.5</td></tr>
<tr><td>5.5</td><td>19</td><td>16</td><td>25</td><td>27</td></tr>
<tr><td>6.</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>51</td><td>7</td></tr>
<tr><td>6.5</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>57</td><td>2</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>We can calculate the value of the average <i>ET</i> if we assume
that the distribution of wrong judgments is in general in accordance
with the law of error curve. We see by inspection of the
<span class="pagenum">[106]</span><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>first three columns that this value lies between 5.0 and 5.5, and
hence the 32 cases of <i>S</i> for <i>CT</i> 5.0 must be considered correct,
or the principle of the error curve will not apply.</p>

<p>The method of computation may be derived in the following
way: If we take the origin so that the maximum of the error
curve falls on the <i>Y</i> axis, the equation of the curve becomes</p>

<p class="ctr"><i>y = ke<sup>-&gamma;<sup>2</sup>x<sup>2</sup></sup></i></p>

<p>and, assuming two points (<i>x<sub>1</sub> y<sub>1</sub></i>) and (<i>x<sub>2</sub> y<sub>2</sub></i>) on the curve, we deduce
the formula</p>

<div class="center"><table summary="Formula">
<tr><td></td><td><i>&plusmn;D &radic; <span class="overline">log k/y</span><sub>1</sub></i></td></tr>
<tr><td><i>x<sub>1</sub></i> =</td><td>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><i>&radic;<span class="overline">log k/y</span><sub>1</sub> &plusmn; &radic;<span class="overline">log k/y</span><sub>2</sub></i></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>where <i>D = x<sub>1</sub> &plusmn; x<sub>2</sub></i>, and <i>k</i> = value of <i>y</i> when <i>x</i> = 0.</p>

<p><i>x<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>x<sub>2</sub></i> must, however, not be great, since the condition
that the curve with which we are dealing shall approximate the
form denoted by the equation is more nearly fulfilled by those
portions of the curve lying nearest to the <i>Y</i> axis.</p>

<p>Now since for any ordinates, <i>y<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>y<sub>2</sub></i> which we may select
from the table, we know the value of <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> &plusmn; <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>, we can compute
the value of <i>x<sub>1</sub></i>, which conversely gives us the amount to be
added to or subtracted from a given term in the series of <i>CT</i>'s
to produce the value of the average <i>ET</i>. This latter value, we
find, by computing by the formula given above, using the four
terms whose values lie nearest to the <i>Y</i> axis, is 5.25 secs.</p>

<p>In Table II are given similar computations for each of the
nine subjects employed, and from this it will be seen that in

<p>The overestimation, however, is of no great significance, for
data will be introduced a little later which show definitely that
the underestimation or overestimation of a given standard is determined,
among other factors, by the intensity of the stimulation
employed. The apparently anomalous results obtained in
the early investigations are in part probably explicable on this
basis.</p>

<p>As regards the results of <i>practice</i>, the data obtained from
the two subjects on whom the greatest number of tests was
made (<i>Hs</i> and <i>Sh</i>) is sufficiently explicit. The errors for
each successive group of 25 series for these two subjects are

<p>No influence arising from practice is discoverable from this
table, and we may safely conclude that this hypothetical factor
may be disregarded, although among the experimenters on
auditory time Mehner<a name="FNanchor_13_60" id="FNanchor_13_60"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_13_60'>13</a> thought results gotten without a maximum
of practice are worthless, while Meumann<a name="FNanchor_14_61" id="FNanchor_14_61"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_14_61'>14</a> thinks that unpracticed
and hence unsophisticated subjects are most apt to give
unbiased results, as with more experience they tend to fall into
ruts and exaggerate their mistakes. The only stipulation we
feel it necessary to make in this connection is that the subject
be given enough preliminary tests to make him thoroughly
familiar with the conditions of the experiment.</p>

<p>2. The second group of experiments introduced the factor
of a difference between the stimulation marking the end of an
interval and that marking the beginning, in the form of a change
in locality stimulated, from one finger to the other, either on
the same hand or on the other hand. Two classes of series
were given, in one of which the change was introduced in the
standard interval, and in the other class in the compared interval.</p>

<p>In the first of these experiments, which are typical of the
whole group, both of the subject's hands were employed, and
a tapping instrument was arranged above the middle finger of
each, as above the one hand in the preceding experiment, the
distance between middle fingers being fifteen inches. The taps
were given either two on the right hand and the third on the
left, or one on the right and the second and third on the left,
the two orders being designated as <i>RRL</i> and <i>RLL</i> respectively.
The subject was always informed of the order in
<span class="pagenum">[109]</span><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>which the stimulations were to be given, so that any element of
surprise which might arise from it was eliminated. Occasionally,
however, through a lapse of memory, the subject expected
the wrong order, in which case the disturbance caused by surprise
was usually so great as to prevent any estimation.</p>

<p>The two types of series were taken under as similar conditions
as possible, four (or in some cases five) tests being taken
from each series alternately. Other conditions were the same
as in the preceding work. The results for the six subjects
employed are given in Table IV.</p>

<p>From Table IV. it is apparent at a glance that the new condition
involved introduces a marked change in the time judgment.
Comparison with Table II. shows that in the cases of
all except <i>Sh</i> and <i>Sn</i> the variation <i>RRL</i> shortens the standard
subjectively, and that <i>RLL</i> lengthens it; that is, a local change
tends to lengthen the interval in which it occurs. In the case of
<i>Sh</i> neither introduces any change of consequence, while in the
case of <i>Sn</i> both values are higher than we might expect,
although the difference between them is in conformity with the
rest of the results shown in the table.</p>

<p>Another set of experiments was made on subject <i>Mr</i>, using
taps on the middle finger of the left hand and a spot on the
forearm fifteen inches from it; giving in one case two taps on
the finger and the third on the arm, and in the other one tap on
the finger and the second and third on the arm; designating the
orders as <i>FFA</i> and <i>FAA</i> respectively. Sixty series were taken,
and the values found for the average <i>ET</i> were 4.52 secs, for
<i>FFA</i> and 6.24 secs, for <i>FAA</i>, <i>ST</i> being 5.0 secs. This shows
0.5 sec. more difference than the experiment with two hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[110]</span><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>Next, experiments were made on two subjects, with conditions
the same as in the work corresponding to Table IV.,
except that the distance between the fingers stimulated was only
five inches. The results of this work are given in Table V.</p>

<h5>TABLE V.</h5>

</table></div>

<p>It will be noticed that <i>Hs</i> shows a slightly wider divergence
than before, while <i>Sh</i> pursues the even tenor of his way as
usual.</p>

<p>Series were next obtained by employing the first and second
fingers on one hand in exactly the same way as the middle
fingers of the two hands were previously employed, the orders
of stimulation being 1, 1, 2, and 1, 2, 2. The results of sixty
series on Subject <i>Hs</i> give the values of average <i>ET</i> as 4.8
secs. for 1, 1, 2, and 6.23 sees, for 1, 2, 2, <i>ST</i> being 5.0 secs.,
showing less divergence than in the preceding work.</p>

<p>These experiments were all made during the first year's
work. They show that in most cases a change in the locality
stimulated influences the estimation of the time interval, but
since the details of that influence do not appear so definitely as
might be desired, the ground was gone over again in a little
different way at the beginning of the present year.</p>

<p>A somewhat more serviceable instrument for time measurements
was employed, consisting of a disc provided with four rows
of sockets in which pegs were inserted at appropriate angular
intervals, so that their contact with fixed levers during the revolution
of the disc closed an electric circuit at predetermined
time intervals. The disc was rotated at a uniform speed by an
electric motor.</p>

<p>Experiments were made by stimulation of the following
localities: (1) First and third fingers of right hand; (2) first
and second fingers of right hand; (3) first fingers of both hands,
close together, but just escaping contact; (4) first fingers of
both hands, fifteen inches apart; (5) first fingers of both hands,
thirty inches apart; (6) two positions on middle finger of right
hand, on same transverse line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[111]</span><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>A standard of two seconds was adopted as being easier for
the subject and more expeditious, and since qualitative and not
quantitative results were desired, only one <i>CT</i> was used in each
case, thus permitting the investigation to cover in a number of
weeks ground which would otherwise have required a much
longer period. The subjects were, however, only informed
that the objective variations were very small, and not that they
were in most cases zero. Tests of the two types complementary
to each other (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>RRL</i> and <i>RRL</i>) were in each case taken
alternately in groups of five, as in previous work.</p>

<div class="tblexp"><p>In the series designated as (1a) the conditions were the same as in (1),
except that the subject abstracted as much as possible from the tactual nature
of the stimulations and the position of the fingers. This was undertaken upon
the suggestion of the subject that it would be possible to perform the abstraction,
and was not repeated on any other subject.</p></div>

<p>The results are given in Table VI., where the numerals in
<span class="pagenum">[112]</span><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>the headings indicate the localities and changes of stimulation,
in accordance with the preceding scheme, and <i>'S'</i>, <i>'E'</i> and
<i>'L'</i> designate the number of judgments of <i>shorter, equal</i> and
<i>longer</i> respectively.</p>

<p>It will be observed that in several cases a <i>CT</i> was introduced
in one class which was different from the <i>CT</i> used in the
other classes with the same subject. This was not entirely
arbitrary. It was found with subject <i>W</i>, for example, that
the use of <i>CT</i> = 2.0 in (3) produced judgments of shorter
almost entirely in both types. Therefore a <i>CT</i> was found, by
trial, which produced a diversity of judgments. The comparison
of the different classes is not so obvious under these
conditions as it otherwise would be, but is still possible.</p>

<p>The comparison gives results which at first appear quite
irregular. These are shown in Table VII. below, where the
headings (1)&mdash;(3), etc., indicate the classes compared, and in
the lines beneath them + indicates that the interval under consideration
is estimated as relatively greater (more overestimated
or less underestimated) in the second of the two classes than in
the first,&mdash;indicating the opposite effect. Results for the first
interval are given in the line denoted 'first,' and for the second
interval in the line denoted 'second.' Thus, the plus sign under
(1)&mdash;(3) in the first line for subject <i>P</i> indicates that the variation
<i>RLL</i> caused the first interval to be overestimated to a greater
extent than did the variation 133.</p>

<p>The comparisons of (6) and (2), and (1) and (3) confirm
the provisional deduction from Table IV., that the introduction
of a <i>local change</i> in an interval <i>lengthens</i> it subjectively,
but the comparisons of (3) and (5), (3) and (4), and (2) and (1)
show apparently that while the <i>amount</i> of the local change influences
the lengthening of the interval, it does not vary directly
with this latter in all cases, but inversely in the first interval and
directly in the second. This is in itself sufficient to demonstrate
<span class="pagenum">[113]</span><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>that the chief factors of the influence of locality-change upon
the time interval are connected with the spatial localization of
the areas stimulated, but a further consideration strengthens the
conclusion and disposes of the apparent anomaly. It will be
noticed that in general the decrease in the comparative length
of the first interval produced by increasing the spatial change
is less than the increase in the comparative length of the second
interval produced by a corresponding change. In other words,
the disparity between the results for the two types of test is
greater, the greater the spatial distance introduced.</p>

<p>The results seem to point to the existence of two distinct
factors in the so-called 'constant error' in these cases: first, what
we may call the <i>bare constant error</i>, or simply the constant
error, which appears when the conditions of stimulation are
objectively the same as regards both intervals, and which we
must suppose to be present in all other cases; and second, the
particular lengthening effect which a change in locality produces
upon the interval in which it occurs. These two factors
may work in conjunction or in opposition, according to conditions.
The bare constant error does not remain exactly the
same at all times for any individual and is probably less regular
in tactual time than in auditory or in optical time, according
to the irregularity actually found and for reasons which will be
assigned later.</p>

<p>3. The third group of experiments introduced the factor of
variation in intensity of stimulation. By the introduction of a
loop in the circuit, containing a rheostat, two strengths of current
and consequently of stimulus intensity were obtained, either
of which could be employed as desired. One intensity, designated
as <i>W</i>, was just strong enough to be perceived distinctly.
The other intensity, designated as <i>S</i>, was somewhat stronger
than the intensity used in the preceding work.</p>

<p>In the first instance, sixty series were taken from Subject <i>B</i>,
with the conditions the same as in the experiments of Group 1,
except that two types of series were taken; the first two stimulations
being strong and the third one weak in the first type
(<i>SSW</i>), and the order being reversed in the second type
(<i>WSS</i>). The results gave values of <i>ET</i> of 5.27 secs. for
<i>SSW</i> and 5.9 secs. for <i>WSS</i>.<span class="pagenum">[114]</span><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a></p>

<p>In order to get comprehensive qualitative results as rapidly
as possible, a three-second standard was adopted in the succeeding
work and only one compared interval, also three seconds,
was given, although the subject was ignorant of that
fact&mdash;the method being thus similar to that adopted later for the
final experiments of Group 2, described above. Six types of
tests were given, the order of stimulation in the different types
being <i>SSS, WWW, SSW, WWS, SWW</i> and <i>WSS</i>, the subject
always knowing which order to expect. For each of the
six types one hundred tests were made on one subject and one
hundred and five on another, in sets of five tests of each type,
the sets being taken in varied order, so that possible contrast
effect should be avoided. The results were practically the
same, however, in whatever order the sets were taken, no contrast
effect being discernible.</p>

<p>The total number of judgments of <i>CT</i>, longer, equal, and
shorter, is given in Table VIII. The experiments on each subject
consumed a number of experiment hours, scattered through
several weeks, but the relative proportions of judgments on
different days was in both cases similar to the total proportions.</p>

</table></div>

<p>By the above table the absolute intensity of the stimulus is
clearly shown to be an important factor in determining the constant
error of judgment, since in both cases the change from
<i>SSS</i> to <i>WWW</i> changed the sign of the constant error, although
in opposite directions. But the effect of the relative intensity
is more obscure. To discover more readily whether the introduction
of a stronger or weaker stimulation promises a definite

<p>There seems at first sight to be no uniformity about these
results. Decreasing the first stimulation in the first case increases,
in the second case diminishes, the comparative length
of the first interval. We get a similar result in the decreasing
of the second stimulation. In the case of the third stimulation
only does the decrease produce a uniform result. If, however,
we neglect the first pair of (3), we observe that in the other
cases the effect of a <i>difference</i> between the two stimulations is
to lengthen the interval which they limit. The fact that both
subjects make the same exception is, however, striking and suggestive
of doubt. These results were obtained in the first year's
work, and to test their validity the experiment was repeated at
the beginning of the present year on three subjects, fifty series
being taken from each, with the results given in Table X.</p>

Analysis of this table shows that in every case a difference
between the intensities of the first and second taps lengthens the
first interval in comparative estimation. In the case of subject
<i>Mm</i> a difference in the intensities of the second and third taps
lengthens the second interval subjectively. But in the cases of
the other two subjects the difference shortens the interval in
varying degrees.</p>

<p>The intensity difference established for the purposes of these
experiments was not great, being less than that established for
the work on the first two subjects, and therefore the fact that
these results are less decided than those of the first work was
not unexpected. The results are, however, very clear, and
show that the lengthening effect of a difference in intensity of
the stimulations limiting an interval has its general application
only to the first interval, being sometimes reversed in the second.
From the combined results we find, further, that a uniform
change in the intensity of three stimulations is capable of
reversing the direction of the constant error, an intensity change
in a given direction changing the error from positive to negative
for some subjects, and from negative to positive for others.</p>

<h3>III. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS.</h3>

<p>We may say provisionally that the <i>change</i> from a tactual
stimulation of one kind to a tactual stimulation of another kind
tends to lengthen subjectively the interval which the two limit.
If we apply the same generalization to the other sensorial
realms, we discover that it agrees with the general results
obtained by Meumann<a name="FNanchor_15_62" id="FNanchor_15_62"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_15_62'>15</a> in investigating the effects of intensity
changes upon auditory time, and also with the results obtained
by Schumann<a name="FNanchor_16_63" id="FNanchor_16_63"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_16_63'>16</a> in investigations with stimulations addressed
alternately to one ear and to the other. Meumann reports also
that the change from stimulation of one sense to stimulation of
another subjectively lengthens the corresponding interval.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[117]</span><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>What, then, are the factors, introduced by the change, which
produce this lengthening effect? The results of introspection
on the part of some of the subjects of our experiments furnish
the clue which may enable us to construct a working hypothesis.</p>

<p>Many of the subjects visualize a time line in the form of a
curve. In each case of this kind the introduction of a change,
either in intensity or location, if large enough to produce an
effect on the time estimation, produced a distortion on the part
of the curve corresponding to the interval affected. All of the
subjects employed in the experiments of Group 2 were distinctly
conscious of the change in attention from one point to
another, as the two were stimulated successively, and three of
them, <i>Hy</i>, <i>Hs</i> and <i>P</i>, thought of something passing from one
point to the other, the representation being described as partly
muscular and partly visual. Subjects <i>Mr</i> and <i>B</i> visualized
the two hands, and consciously transferred the attention from
one part of the visual image to the other. Subject <i>Mr</i> had a
constant tendency to make eye movements in the direction of
the change. Subject <i>P</i> detected these eye movements a few
times, but subject <i>B</i> was never conscious of anything of the
kind.</p>

<p>All of the subjects except <i>R</i> were conscious of more or less
of a <i>strain</i>, which varied during the intervals, and was by some
felt to be largely a tension of the chest and other muscles, while
others felt it rather indefinitely as a 'strain of attention.' The
characteristics of this tension feeling were almost always different
in the second interval from those in the first, the tension
being usually felt to be more <i>constant</i> in the second interval.
In experiments of the third group a higher degree of tension
was felt in awaiting a light tap than in awaiting a heavy one.</p>

<p>Evidently, in all these cases, the effect of a <i>difference</i>
between two stimulations was to introduce certain changes in
sensation <i>during</i> the interval which they limited, owing to the
fact that the subject expected the difference to occur. Thus in
the third group of experiments there were, very likely, in all
cases changes from sensations of high tension to sensations
of lower, or vice versa. It is probable that, in the experiments
of the second group, there were also changes in muscular
<span class="pagenum">[118]</span><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>sensations, partly those of eye muscles, partly of chest and arm
muscles, introduced by the change of attention from one point
to another. At any rate, it is certain that there were certain
sensation changes produced during the intervals by changes of
locality.</p>

<p>If, then, we assume that the introduction of additional sensation
change into an interval lengthens it, we are led to the
conclusion that psychological time (as distinguished from metaphysical,
mathematical, or transcendental time) is perceived
simply as the quantum of change in the sensation content.
That this is a true conclusion is seemingly supported by the
fact that when we wish to make our estimate correspond as
closely as possible with external measurements, we exclude
from the content, to the best of our ability, the general complex
of external sensations, which vary with extreme irregularity;
and confine the attention to the more uniformly varying bodily
sensations. We perhaps go even further, and inhibit certain
bodily sensations, corresponding to activity of the more peripherally
located muscles, that the attention may be confined to
certain others. But attention to a dermal stimulation is precisely
the condition which would tend to some extent to prevent
this inhibition. For this reason we might well expect to find
the error in estimation more variable, the 'constant error' in
general greater, and the specific effects of variations which
would affect the peripheral muscles, more marked in 'tactual'
time than in either 'auditory' or 'optical' time. Certainly all
these factors appear surprisingly large in these experiments.</p>

<p>It is not possible to ascertain to how great an extent subject
<i>Sh</i> inhibited the more external sensations, but certainly if he
succeeded to an unusual degree in so doing, that fact would
explain the absence of effect of stimulation difference in his
case.</p>

<p>Explanation has still to be offered for the variable effect of
intensity difference upon the <i>second</i> interval. According to all
subjects except <i>Sn</i>, there is a radical difference in attitude in
the two intervals. In the first interval the subject is merely
observant, but in the second he is more or less reproductive.
That is, he measures off a length which seems equal to the
<span class="pagenum">[119]</span><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>standard, and if the stimulation does not come at that point he
is prepared to judge the interval as 'longer,' even before the
third stimulation is given. In cases, then, where the judgment
with equal intensities would be 'longer,' we might expect that
the actual strengthening or weakening of the final tap would
make no difference, and that it would make very little difference
in other cases. But even here the expectation of the intensity
is an important factor in determining tension changes, although
naturally much less so than in the first interval. So we should
still expect the lengthening of the second interval.</p>

<p>We must remember, however, that, as we noticed in discussing
the experiments of Group 2, there is complicated with
the lengthening effect of a change the <i>bare constant error</i>,
which appears even when the three stimulations are similar in
all respects except temporal location. Compare <i>WWW</i> with
<i>SSS</i>, and we find that with all five subjects the constant error
is decidedly changed, being even reversed in direction with three
of the subjects.</p>

<p>Now, what determines the direction of the constant error,
where there is no pause between the intervals? Three subjects
reported that at times there seemed to be a slight loss of time
after the second stimulation, owing to the readjustment called
for by the change of attitude referred to above, so that the
second interval was begun, not really at the second stimulation,
but a certain period after it. This fact, if we assume it to be
such, and also assume that it is present to a certain degree in
all observations of this kind, explains the apparent overestimation
of the first interval. Opposed to the factor of <i>loss of time</i>
there is the factor of <i>perspective</i>, by which an interval, or part
of an interval, seems less in quantity as it recedes into the past.
The joint effect of these two factors determines the constant
error in any case where no pause is introduced between <i>ST</i> and
<i>CT</i>. It is then perfectly obvious that, as the perspective factor
is decreased by diminishing the intervals compared, the constant
error must receive positive increments, <i>i.e.</i>, become algebraically
greater; which corresponds exactly with the results obtained
by Vierordt, Kollert, Estel, and Glass, that under ordinary
conditions long standard intervals are comparatively underestimated,
and short ones overestimated.<span class="pagenum">[120]</span><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a></p>

<p>On the other hand, if with a given interval we vary the
loss of time, we also vary the constant error. We have seen
that a change in the intensity of the stimulations, although the
relative intensity of the three remains constant, produces this
variation of the constant error; and the individual differences of
subjects with regard to sensibility, power of attention and inhibition,
and preferences for certain intensities, lead us to the
conclusion that for certain subjects certain intensities of stimulation
make the transition from the receptive attitude to the
reproductive easiest, and, therefore, most rapid.</p>

<p>Now finally, as regards the apparent failure of the change
in <i>SSW</i> to lengthen the second interval, for which we are seeking
to account; the comparatively great loss of time occurring
where the change of attitude would naturally be most difficult
(that is, where it is complicated with a change of attention from
a strong stimulation to the higher key of a weak stimulation) is
sufficient to explain why with most subjects the lengthening
effect upon the second interval is more than neutralized. The
individual differences mentioned in the preceding paragraph as
affecting the relation of the two factors determining the constant
error, enter here of course to modify the judgments and
cause disagreement among the results for different subjects.</p>

<p>Briefly stated, the most important points upon which this
discussion hinges are thus the following: We have shown&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That the introduction of either a local difference or a
difference of intensity in the tactual stimulations limiting an
interval has, in general, the effect of causing the interval to
appear longer than it otherwise would appear.</p>

<p>2. That the apparent exceptions to the above rule are, (<i>a</i>)
that the <i>increase</i> of the local difference in the first interval, the
stimulated areas remaining unchanged, produces a slight <i>decrease</i>
in the subjective lengthening of the interval, and (<i>b</i>)
that in certain cases a difference in intensity of the stimulations
limiting the second interval apparently causes the interval to
seem shorter than it otherwise would.</p>

<p>3. That the 'constant error' of time judgment is dependent
upon the intensity of the stimulations employed, although the
three stimulations limiting the two intervals remain of equal
intensity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[121]</span><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>To harmonize these results we have found it necessary to
assume:</p>

<p>1. That the length of a time interval is perceived as the
amount of change in the sensation-complex corresponding to
that interval.</p>

<p>2. That the so-called 'constant error' of time estimation
is determined by two mutually opposing factors, of which the
first is the <i>loss of time</i> occasioned by the change of attitude at
the division between the two intervals, and the second is the
diminishing effect of <i>perspective</i>.</p>

<p>It is evident, however, that this last assumption applies only
to the conditions under which the results were obtained, namely,
the comparison of two intervals marked off by three brief
stimulations.</p>

<h2><a name="PER4" id="PER4"></a>PERCEPTION OF NUMBER THROUGH TOUCH.</h2>

<h4>BY J. FRANKLIN MESSENGER.</h4>

<p>The investigation which I am now reporting began as a
study of the fusion of touch sensations when more than two contacts
were possible. As the work proceeded new questions
came up and the inquiry broadened so much that it seemed more
appropriate to call it a study in the perception of number.</p>

<p>The experiments are intended to have reference chiefly to
three questions: the space-threshold, fusion of touch sensations,
and the perception of number. I shall deny the validity
of a threshold, and deny that there is fusion, and then offer a
theory which attempts to explain the phenomena connected with
the determination of a threshold and the problem of fusion and
diffusion of touch sensations.</p>

<p>The first apparatus used for the research was made as follows:
Two uprights were fastened to a table. These supported
a cross-bar about ten inches from the table. To this bar
was fastened a row of steel springs which could be pressed
down in the manner of piano keys. To each of these springs
was fastened a thread which held a bullet. The bullets, which
were wrapped in silk to obviate temperature sensations, were
thus suspended just above the fingers, two over each finger.
Each thread passed through a small ring which was held just a
little above the fingers. These rings could be moved in any
direction to accommodate the bullet to the position of the finger.
Any number of the bullets could be let down at once. The
main object at first was to learn something about the fusion of
sensations when more than two contacts were given.</p>

<p>Special attention was given to the relation of the errors
made when the fingers were near together to those made when
the fingers were spread. For this purpose a series of experiments
<span class="pagenum">[124]</span><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>was made with the fingers close together, and then the
series was repeated with the fingers spread as far as possible
without the subject's feeling any strain. Each subject was
experimented on one hour a week for about three months.
The same kind of stimulation was given when the fingers were
near together as was given when they were spread. The figures
given below represent the average percentage of errors for
four subjects.</p>

<p>Of the total number of answers given by all subjects when
the fingers were close together, 70 per cent. were wrong. An
answer was called wrong whenever the subject failed to judge
the number correctly. In making out the figures I did not take
into account the nature of the errors. Whether involving too
many or too few the answer was called wrong. Counting up
the number of wrong answers when the fingers were spread, I
found that 28 per cent. of the total number of answers were
wrong. This means simply that when the fingers were near
together there were more than twice as many errors as there
were when they were spread, in spite of the fact that each finger
was stimulated in the same way in each case.</p>

<p>A similar experiment was tried using the two middle fingers
only. In this case not more than four contacts could be made
at once, and hence we should expect a smaller number of
errors, but we should expect still to find more of them when the
fingers are near together than when they are spread. I found
that 49 per cent. of the answers were wrong when the fingers
were near together and 20 per cent. were wrong when they
were spread. It happens that this ratio is approximately the
same as the former one, but I do not regard this fact as
very significant. I state only that it is easier to judge in one
case than in the other; how much easier may depend on various
factors.</p>

<p>To carry the point still further I took only two bullets, one
over the second phalanx of each middle finger. When the fingers
were spread the two were never felt as one. When the
fingers were together they were often felt as one.</p>

<p>The next step was to investigate the effect of bringing together
the fingers of opposite hands. I asked the subject to
<span class="pagenum">[125]</span><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>clasp his hands in such a way that the second phalanges would
be about even. I could not use the same apparatus conveniently
with the hands in this position, but in order to have the contacts
as similar as possible to those I had been using, I took four
of the same kind of bullets and fastened them to the ends of two
&aelig;sthesiometers. This enabled me to give four contacts at once.
However, only two were necessary to show that contacts on fingers
of opposite hands could be made to 'fuse' by putting the
fingers together. If two contacts are given on contiguous fingers,
they are quite as likely to be perceived as one when the
fingers are fingers of opposite hands, as when they are contiguous
fingers of the same hand.</p>

<p>These results seem to show that one of the important elements
of fusion is the actual space relations of the points stimulated.
The reports of the subjects also showed that generally
and perhaps always they located the points in space and then
remembered what finger occupied that place. It was not uncommon
for a subject to report a contact on each of two adjacent
fingers and one in between where he had no finger. A
moment's reflection would usually tell him it must be an illusion,
but the sensation of this illusory finger was as definite as that of
any of his real fingers. In such cases the subject seemed to
perceive the relation of the points to each other, but failed to
connect them with the right fingers. For instance, if contacts
were made on the first, second and third fingers, the first might
be located on the first finger, the third on the second finger, and
then the second would be located in between.</p>

<p>So far my attention had been given almost entirely to fusion,
but the tendency on the part of all subjects to report more contacts
than were actually given was so noticeable that I concluded
that diffusion was nearly as common as fusion and
about as easy to produce. It also seemed that the element of
weight might play some part, but just what effect it had I was
uncertain. I felt, too, that knowledge of the apparatus gained
through sight was giving the subjects too much help. The
subjects saw the apparatus every day and knew partly what to
expect, even though the eyes were closed when the contacts
were made. A more efficient apparatus seemed necessary, and,
<span class="pagenum">[126]</span><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>therefore, before taking up the work again in 1900, I made a
new apparatus.</p>

<p>Not wishing the subjects to know anything about the nature
of the machine or what could be done with it, I enclosed it in a
box with an opening in one end large enough to allow the
subject's hand to pass through, and a door in the other end
through which I could operate. On the inside were movable
wooden levers, adjustable to hands of different width. These
were fastened by pivotal connection at the proximal end. At
the outer end of each of these was an upright strip with a slot,
through which was passed another strip which extended back
over the hand. This latter strip could be raised or lowered by
means of adjusting screws in the upright strip. On the horizontal
strip were pieces of wood made so as to slide back and
forth. Through holes in these pieces plungers were passed.
At the bottom of each plunger was a small square piece of
wood held and adjusted by screws. From this piece was suspended
a small thimble filled with shot and paraffine. The
thimbles were all equally weighted. Through a hole in the
plunger ran a thread holding a piece of lead of exactly the
weight of the thimble. By touching a pin at the top this weight
could be dropped into the thimble, thus doubling its weight. A
screw at the top of the piece through which the plunger passed
regulated the stop of the plunger. This apparatus had three
important advantages. It was entirely out of sight, it admitted
of rapid and accurate adjustment, and it allowed the weights to
be doubled quickly and without conspicuous effort.</p>

<p>For the purpose of studying the influence of weight on
the judgments of number I began a series of experiments to
train the subjects to judge one, two, three, or four contacts
at once. For this the bare metal thimbles were used, because
it was found that when they were covered with chamois
skin the touch was so soft that the subjects could not perceive
more than one or two with any degree of accuracy, and I
thought it would take entirely too long to train them to perceive
four. The metal thimbles, of course, gave some temperature
sensation, but the subject needed the help and it seemed best to
use the more distinct metal contacts.<span class="pagenum">[127]</span><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a></p>

<p>In this work I had seven subjects, all of whom had had
some experience in a laboratory, most of them several years.
Each one took part one hour a week. The work was intended
merely for training, but a few records were taken each day to
see how the subjects progressed. The object was to train them
to perceive one, two, three, and four correctly, and not only to
distinguish four from three but to distinguish four from more
than four. Hence five, six, seven, and eight at a time were
often given. When the subject had learned to do this fairly
well the plan was to give him one, two, three, and four in order,
then to double the weight of the four and give them again to
see if he would interpret the additional weight as increase in
number. This was done and the results were entirely negative.
The subjects either noticed no difference at all or else
merely noticed that the second four were a little more distinct
than the first.</p>

<p>The next step was to give a number of light contacts to be
compared with the same number of heavy ones&mdash;the subject,
not trying to tell the exact number but only which group contained
the greater number. A difference was sometimes
noticed, and the subject, thinking that the only variations possible
were variations of number and position, often interpreted
the difference as difference in number; but the light weights
were as often called more as were the heavy ones.</p>

<p>So far as the primary object of this part of the experiment
is concerned the results are negative, but incidentally the process
of training brought out some facts of a more positive
nature. It was early noticed that some groups of four were
much more readily recognized than others, and that some
of them were either judged correctly or underestimated while
others were either judged correctly or overestimated. For
convenience the fingers were indicated by the letters <i>A B C
D</i>, <i>A</i> being the index finger. The thumb was not used.
Two weights were over each finger. The one near the base
was called 1, the one toward the end 2. Thus <i>A12 B1 C2</i>
means two contacts on the index finger, one near the base of
the second finger, and one near the end of the third finger. The
possible arrangements of four may be divided into three types:<span class="pagenum">[128]</span><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>
(1) Two weights on each of two fingers, as <i>A12 B12, C12 D12</i>,
etc., (2) four in a line across the fingers, <i>A1 B1 C1 D1</i> or <i>A2
B2 C2 D2</i>, (3) unsymmetrical arrangements, as <i>A1 B2 C1 D2</i>,
etc. Arrangements of the first type were practically never
overestimated. <i>B12 C12</i> was overestimated once and <i>B12
D12</i> was overestimated once, but these two isolated cases need
hardly be taken into account. Arrangements of the second
type were but rarely overestimated&mdash;<i>A2 B2 C2 D2</i> practically
never, <i>A1 B1 C1 D1</i> a few times. Once the latter was called
eight. Apparently the subject perceived the line across the
hand and thought there were two weights on each finger instead
of one. Arrangements of the third type were practically never
underestimated, but were overestimated in 68 per cent. of the
cases.</p>

<p>These facts in themselves are suggestive, but equally so was
the behavior of the subject while making the answers. It
would have hardly done to ask the person if certain combinations
were hard to judge, for the question would serve as a suggestion
to him; but it was easy to tell when a combination was
difficult without asking questions. When a symmetrical arrangement
was given, the subject was usually composed and answered
without much hesitation. When an unsymmetrical arrangement
was given he often hesitated and knit his brows or perhaps used
an exclamation of perplexity before answering, and after giving
his answer he often fidgeted in his chair, drew a long breath,
or in some way indicated that he had put forth more effort than
usual. It might be expected that the same attitude would be
taken when six or eight contacts were made at once, but in these
cases the subject was likely either to fail to recognize that a
large number was given or, if he did, he seemed to feel that it
was too large for him to perceive at all and would guess at it
as well as he could. But when only four were given, in a zigzag
arrangement, he seemed to feel that he ought to be able to
judge the number but to find it hard to do so, and knowing from
experience that the larger the number the harder it is to judge
he seemed to reason conversely that the more effort it takes to
judge the more points there are, and hence he would overestimate
the number.<span class="pagenum">[129]</span><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a></p>

<p>The comments of the subjects are of especial value. One
subject (Mr. Dunlap) reports that he easily loses the sense of
location of his fingers, and the spaces in between them seem to
belong to him as much as do his fingers themselves. When
given one touch at a time and told to raise the finger touched
he can do so readily, but he says he does not know which finger
it is until he moves it. He feels as if he willed to move the
place touched without reference to the finger occupying it. He
sometimes hesitates in telling which finger it is, and sometimes
he finds out when he moves a finger that it is not the one he
thought it was.</p>

<p>Another subject (Dr. MacDougall) says that his fingers seem
to him like a continuous surface, the same as the back of his
hand. He usually named the outside points first. When asked
about the order in which he named them, he said he named the
most distinct ones first. Once he reported that he felt six
things, but that two of them were in the same places as two
others, and hence he concluded there were but four. This
feeling in a less careful observer might lead to overestimation
of number and be called diffusion, but all cases of overestimation
cannot be explained that way, for it does not explain
why certain combinations are so much more likely to lead to it
than others.</p>

<p>In one subject (Mr. Swift) there was a marked tendency to
locate points on the same fingers. He made many mistakes
about fingers <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> even when he reported the number correctly.
When <i>B</i> and <i>D</i> were touched at the same time he
would often call it <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>, and when <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> were given
immediately afterward he seemed to notice no difference. With
various combinations he would report <i>C</i> when <i>B</i> was given,
although <i>C</i> had not been touched at the same time. If <i>B</i> and
<i>C</i> were touched at the same time he could perceive them well
enough.</p>

<p>The next part of the research was an attempt to discover
whether a person can perceive any difference between one point
and two points which feel like one. A simple little experiment
was tried with the &aelig;sthesiometer. The subjects did not know
what was being used, and were asked to compare the relative
<span class="pagenum">[130]</span><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>size of two objects placed on the back of the hand in succession.
One of these objects was one knob of the &aelig;sthesiometer and
the other was two knobs near enough together to lie within the
threshold. The distance of the points was varied from 10 to
15 mm. Part of the time the one was given first and part of the
time both were given together. The one, whether given first
or second, was always given about midway between the points
touched by the two. If the subject is not told to look for some
specific difference he will not notice any difference between the
two knobs and the one, and he will say they are alike; but if
he is told to give particular attention to the size there seems to
be a slight tendency to perceive a difference. The subjects
seem to feel very uncertain about their answers, and it looks
very much like guess-work, but something caused the guesses
to go more in one direction than in the other.</p>

<div class="center"><table summary="2 compared to 1" border="0" width="50%">
<tr><td>Two were called</td><td>less than</td><td>one</td><td>16%</td><td>of the times given.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;</td><td>equal to</td><td>&quot;</td><td>48%</td><td>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;</td><td>greater than</td><td>&quot;</td><td>36%</td><td>&quot;</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Approximately half of the time two were called equal to
one, and if there had been no difference in the sensations half
of the remaining judgments should have been that two was
smaller than one, but two were called larger than one more
than twice as many times as one was called larger than two.
There was such uniformity in the reports of the different
subjects that no one varied much from this average ratio.</p>

<p>This experiment seems to indicate a very slight power of
discrimination of stimulations within the threshold. In striking
contrast to this is the power to perceive variations of distance
between two points outside the threshold. To test this the
&aelig;sthesiometer was spread enough to bring the points outside
the threshold. The back of the hand was then stimulated with
the two points and then the distance varied slightly, the hand
touched and the subject asked to tell which time the points were
farther apart. A difference of 2 mm. was usually noticed, and
one of from 3 to 5 mm. was noticed always very clearly.</p>

<p>I wondered then what would be the result if small cards set
parallel to each other were used in place of the knobs of the
<span class="pagenum">[131]</span><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>&aelig;sthesiometer. I made an &aelig;sthesiometer with cards 4 mm.
long in place of knobs. These cards could be set at any angle
to each other. I set them at first 10 mm. apart and parallel to
each other and asked the subjects to compare the contact made
by them with a contact by one card of the same size. The
point touched by the one card was always between the points
touched by the two cards, and the one card was put down so
that its edge would run in the same direction as the edges of the
other cards. The result of this was that:</p>

<div class="center"><table summary="2 compared to 1" border="0">
<tr><td>Two were called</td><td>less,</td><td>14</td><td>per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>"</td><td>equal,</td><td>36</td><td>"</td></tr>
<tr><td>"</td><td>greater,</td><td>50</td><td>"</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>I then increased the distance of the two cards to 15 mm., the
other conditions remaining the same, and found that:</p>

<div class="center"><table summary="2 compared to 1" border="0">
<tr><td>Two were called</td><td>less,</td><td>11</td><td>per cent.</td></tr>
<tr><td>"</td><td>equal,</td><td>50</td><td>"</td></tr>
<tr><td>"</td><td>greater,</td><td>39</td><td>"</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>It will be noticed that the ratio in this last series is not materially
different from the ratio found when the two knobs of the
&aelig;sthesiometer were compared with one knob. The ratio
found when the distance was 10 mm., however, is somewhat
different. At that distance two were called greater half of the
time, while at 15 mm. two were called equal to one half of the
time. The explanation of the difference, I think, is found in
the comments of one of my subjects. I did not ask them to
tell in what way one object was larger than the other&mdash;whether
longer or larger all around or what&mdash;but simply to answer
'equal,' 'greater,' or 'less.' One subject, however, frequently
added more to his answers. He would often say 'larger crosswise'
or 'larger lengthwise' of his hand. And a good deal of
the time he reported two larger than one, not in the direction
in which it really was larger, but the other way. It seems to
me that when the two cards were only 10 mm. apart the effect
was somewhat as it would be if a solid object 4 mm. wide and
10 mm. long had been placed on the hand. Such an object
would be recognized as having greater mass than a line 4 mm.<span class="pagenum">[132]</span><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>
long. But when the distance is 15 mm. the impression is less
like that of a solid body but still not ordinarily like two objects.</p>

<p>In connection with the subject of diffusion the <i>Vexirfehler</i>
is of interest. An attempt was made to develop the <i>Vexirfehler</i>
with the &aelig;sthesiometer. Various methods were tried, but the
following was most successful. I would tell the subject that I
was going to use the &aelig;sthesiometer and ask him to close his
eyes and answer simply 'one' or 'two.' He would naturally
expect that he would be given part of the time one, and part
of the time two. I carefully avoided any suggestion other
than that which could be given by the &aelig;sthesiometer itself. I
would begin on the back of the hand near the wrist with the
points as near the threshold as they could be and still be felt as
two. At each successive putting down of the instrument I
would bring the points a little nearer together and a little lower
down on the hand. By the time a dozen or more stimulations
had been given I would be working down near the knuckles,
and the points would be right together. From that on I would
use only one point. It might be necessary to repeat this a few
times before the illusion would persist. A great deal seems to
depend on the skill of the operator. It would be noticed that
the first impression was of two points, and that each stimulation
was so nearly like the one immediately preceding that no difference
could be noticed. The subject has been led to call a
thing two which ordinarily he would call one, and apparently
he loses the distinction between the sensation of one and the
sensation of two. After going through the procedure just mentioned
I put one knob of the &aelig;sthesiometer down one hundred
times in succession, and one subject (Mr. Meakin) called it two
seventy-seven times and called it one twenty-three times. Four
of the times that he called it one he expressed doubt about his
answer and said it might be two, but as he was not certain he
called it one. Another subject (Mr. George) called it two sixty-two
times and one thirty-eight times. A third subject (Dr.
Hylan) called it two seventy-seven times and one twenty-three
times. At the end of the series he was told what had been
done and he said that most of his sensations of two were perfectly
distinct and he believed that he was more likely to call
<span class="pagenum">[133]</span><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>what seemed somewhat like two one, than to call what seemed
somewhat like one two. With the fourth subject (Mr. Dunlap)
I was unable to do what I had done with the others. I could
get him to call one two for four or five times, but the idea of
two would not persist through a series of any length. He
would call it two when two points very close together were
used. I could bring the knobs within two or three millimeters
of each other and he would report two, but when only one
point was used he would find out after a very few stimulations
were given that it was only one. After I had given up the
attempt I told him what I had been trying to do and he gave
what seems to me a very satisfactory explanation of his own
case. He says the early sensations keep coming up in his
mind, and when he feels like calling a sensation two he remembers
how the first sensation felt and sees that this one is
not like that, and hence he calls it one. I pass now to a brief
discussion of what these experiments suggest.</p>

<p>It has long been known that two points near together on the
skin are often perceived as one. It has been held that in order
to be felt as two they must be far enough apart to have a spatial
character, and hence the distance necessary for two points to
be perceived has been called the 'space-threshold.' This
threshold is usually determined either by the method of minimal
changes or by the method of right and wrong cases.</p>

<p>If, in determining a threshold by the method of minimal
changes&mdash;on the back of the hand, for example, we assume
that we can begin the ascending series and find that two are
perceived as one always until the distance of twenty millimeters
is reached, and that in the descending series two are perceived
as two until the distance of ten millimeters is reached, we might
then say that the threshold is somewhere between ten and twenty
millimeters. But if the results were always the same and always
as simple as this, still we could not say that there is any probability
in regard to the answer which would be received if two
contacts 12, 15, or 18 millimeters apart were given by themselves.
All we should know is that if they form part of an
ascending series the answer will be 'one,' if part of a descending
series 'two.'<span class="pagenum">[134]</span><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a></p>

<p>The method of right and wrong cases is also subject to serious
objections. There is no lower limit, for no matter how close
together two points are they are often called two. If there is
any upper limit at all, it is so great that it is entirely useless.
It might be argued that by this method a distance could be
found at which a given percentage of answers would be correct.
This is quite true, but of what value is it? It enables one to
obtain what one arbitrarily calls a threshold, but it can go no
further than that. When the experiment changes the conditions
change. The space may remain the same, but it is only
one of the elements which assist in forming the judgment, and
its importance is very much overestimated when it is made the
basis for determining the threshold.</p>

<p>Different observers have found that subjects sometimes describe
a sensation as 'more than one, but less than two.' I had
a subject who habitually described this feeling as 'one and a
half.' This does not mean that he has one and a half sensations.
That is obviously impossible. It must mean that the
sensation seems just as much like two as it does like one, and he
therefore describes it as half way between. If we could discover
any law governing this feeling of half-way-between-ness,
that might well indicate the threshold. But such feelings are
not common. Sensations which seem between one and two
usually call forth the answer 'doubtful,' and have a negative
rather than a positive character. This negative character cannot
be due to the stimulus; it must be due to the fluctuating attitudes
of the subject. However, if the doubtful cases could be
classed with the 'more than one but less than two' cases and a
law be found governing them, we might have a threshold mark.
But such a law has not been formulated, and if it had been an
analysis of the 'doubtful' cases would invalidate it. For, since
we cannot have half of a sensation or half of a place as we
might have half of an area, the subject regards each stimulation
as produced by one or by two points as the case may be. Occasionally
he is stimulated in such a way that he can regard the
object as two or as one with equal ease. In order to describe
this feeling he is likely to use one or the other of the methods
just mentioned.<span class="pagenum">[135]</span><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a></p>

<p>We might say that when the sum of conditions is such that
the subject perceives two points, the points are above the threshold,
and when the subject perceives one point when two are
given they are below the threshold. This might answer the
purpose very well if it were not for the <i>Vexirfehler</i>. According
to this definition, when the <i>Vexirfehler</i> appears we should
have to say that one point is above the threshold for twoness,
which is a queer contradiction, to say the least. It follows that
all of the elaborate and painstaking experiments to determine a
threshold are useless. That is, the threshold determinations do
not lead us beyond the determinations themselves.</p>

<p>In order to explain the fact that a person sometimes fails to
distinguish between one point and two points near together, it
has been suggested that the sensations fuse. This, I suppose,
means either that the peripheral processes coalesce and go to
the center as a single neural process, or that the process produced
by each stimulus goes separately to the brain and there
the two set up a single activity. Somewhat definite 'sensory
circles,' even, were once believed in.</p>

<p>If the only fact we had to explain was that two points are
often thought to be one when they are near together, 'fusion'
might be a good hypothesis, but we have other facts to consider.
If this one is explained by fusion, then the mistaking of one
point for two must be due to diffusion of sensations. Even that
might be admissible if the <i>Vexirfehler</i> were the only phenomenon
of this class which we met. But it is also true that several
contacts are often judged to be more than they actually are,
and that hypothesis will not explain why certain arrangements
of the stimulating objects are more likely to bring about that
result than others. Still more conclusive evidence against
fusion, it seems to me, is found in the fact that two points, one
on each hand, may be perceived as one when the hands are
brought together. Another argument against fusion is the fact
that two points pressed lightly may be perceived as one, and
when the pressure is increased they are perceived as two.
Strong pressures should fuse better than weak ones, and
therefore fusion would imply the opposite results. Br&uuml;ckner<a name="FNanchor_1_64" id="FNanchor_1_64"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_1_64'>1</a><span class="pagenum">[136]</span><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>
has found that two sensations, each too weak to be perceived
by itself, may be perceived when the two are given simultaneously
and sufficiently near together. This re&euml;nforcement of
sensations he attributes to fusion. But we have a similar phenomenon
in vision when a group of small dots is perceived,
though each dot by itself is imperceptible. No one, I think,
would say this is due to fusion. It does not seem to me that
we need to regard re&euml;nforcement as an indication of fusion.</p>

<p>My contention is that the effects sometimes attributed to
fusion and diffusion of sensations are not two different kinds of
phenomena, but are identical in character and are to be explained
in the same way.</p>

<p>Turning now to the explanation of the special experiments,
we may begin with the <i>Vexirfehler</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_65" id="FNanchor_2_65"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_2_65'>2</a> It seems to me that the
<i>Vexirfehler</i> is a very simple phenomenon. When a person is
stimulated with two objects near together he attends first to one
and then to the other and calls it two; then when he is stimulated
with one object he attends to it, and expecting another
one near by he hunts for it and hits upon the same one he felt
before but fails to remember that it is the same one, and hence
thinks it is another and says he has felt two objects. Observers
agree that the expectation of two tends to bring out the <i>Vexirfehler</i>.
This is quite natural. A person who expects two and
receives one immediately looks about for the other without waiting
to fixate the first, and therefore when he finds it again he is
less likely to recognize it and more likely to think it another
point and to call it two. Some observers<a name="FNanchor_3_66" id="FNanchor_3_66"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_3_66'>3</a> have found that the
apparent distance of the two points when the <i>Vexirfehler</i> appears
never much exceeds the threshold distance. Furthermore, there
being no distinct line of demarcation between one and two,
there must be many sensations which are just about as much
like one as they are like two, and hence they must be lumped
off with one or the other group. To the mathematician one
and two are far apart in the series because he has fractions in
<span class="pagenum">[137]</span><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>between, but we perceive only in terms of whole numbers;
hence all sensations which might more accurately be represented
by fractions must be classed with the nearest whole number.
A sensation is due to a combination of factors. In case of the
<i>Vexirfehler</i> one of these factors, viz., the stimulating object, is
such as to suggest one, but some of the other conditions&mdash;expectation,
preceding sensation, perhaps blood pressure, etc.&mdash;suggest
two, so that the sensation as a whole suggests <i>one-plus</i>, if
we may describe it that way, and hence the inference that the
sensation was produced by two objects.</p>

<p>This, it seems to me, may account for the appearance of the
<i>Vexirfehler</i>, but why should not the subject discover his error
by studying the sensation more carefully? He cannot attend to
two things at once, nor can he attend to one thing continuously,
even for a few seconds. What we may call continuous attention
is only a succession of attentive impulses. If he could
attend to the one object continuously and at the same time hunt
for the other, I see no reason why he should not discover that
there is only one. But if he can have only one sensation at a
time, then all he can do is to associate that particular sensation
with some idea. In the case before us he associates it with the
idea of the number two. He cannot conceive of two objects
unless he conceives them as located in two different places.
Sometimes a person does find that the two objects of his perception
are both in the same place, and when he does so he concludes
at once that there is but one object. At other times he
cannot locate them so accurately, and he has no way of finding
out the difference, and since he has associated the sensation with
the idea of two he still continues to call it two. If he is asked
to locate the points on paper he fills out the figure just as he
fills out the blind-spot, and he can draw them in just the same
way that he can draw lines which he thinks he <i>sees</i> with the
blind-spot, but which really he only <i>infers</i>.</p>

<p>Any sensation, whether produced by one or by many
objects, is one, but there may be a difference in the quality of
a sensation produced by one object and that of a sensation produced
by more than one object. If this difference is clear and
distinct, the person assigns to each sensation the number he has
<span class="pagenum">[138]</span><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>associated with it. He gives it the name two when it has the
quality he has associated with that idea. But the qualities of a
sensation from which the number of objects producing it is
inferred are not always clear and distinct. The quality of the
sensation must not be confused with any quality of the object.
If we had to depend entirely on the sense of touch and always
remained passive and received sensations only when we were
touched by something, there is no reason why we should not
associate the idea of one with the sensation produced by two
objects and the idea of two with that produced by one object&mdash;assuming
that we could have any idea of number under
such circumstances. The quality of a sensation from which
number is inferred depends on several factors. The number
itself is determined by the attitude of the subject, but the attitude
is determined largely by association. A number of facts
show this. When a person is being experimented on, it is very
easy to confuse him and make him forget how two feel and how
one feels. I have often had a subject tell me that he had forgotten
and ask me to give him two distinctly that he might see
how it felt. In other words, he had forgotten how to associate
his ideas and sensations. In developing the <i>Vexirfehler</i> I found
it much better, after sufficient training had been given, not to
give two at all, for it only helped the subject to perceive the
difference between two and one by contrast. But when one
was given continually he had no such means of contrast, and
having associated the idea of two with a sensation he continued
to do so. The one subject with whom I did not succeed in
developing the <i>Vexirfehler</i> to any great extent perceived the
difference by comparing the sensation with one he had had
some time before. I could get him, for a few times, to
answer two when only one was given, but he would soon discover
the difference, and he said he did it by comparing it
with a sensation which he had had some time before and which
he knew was two. By this means he was able to make correct
associations when otherwise he would not have done so. It has
been discovered that when a subject is being touched part of the
time with two and part of the time with one, and the time it
takes him to make his judgments is being recorded, he will
<span class="pagenum">[139]</span><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>recognize two more quickly than he will one if there is a larger
number of twos in the series than there is of ones. I do not see
how this could be if the sensation of two is any more complex
than that of one. But if both sensations are units and all the
subject needs to do is to associate the sensation with an idea,
then we should expect that the association he had made most
frequently would be made the most quickly.</p>

<p>If the feeling of twoness or of oneness is anything but an
inference, why is it that a person can perceive two objects on
two fingers which are some distance apart, but perceives the
same two objects as one when the fingers are brought near
together and touched in the same way? It is difficult to see how
bringing the fingers together could make a sensation any less
complex, but it would naturally lead a person to infer one
object, because of his previous associations. He has learned to
call that <i>one</i> which seems to occupy one place. If two contacts
are made in succession he will perceive them as two because
they are separated for him by the time interval and he can perceive
that they occupy different places.</p>

<p>When two exactly similar contacts are given and are perceived
as one, we cannot be sure whether the subject feels only
one of the contacts and does not feel the other at all, or feels
both contacts and thinks they are in the same place, which is
only another way of saying he feels both as one. It is true
that when asked to locate the point he often locates it between
the two points actually touched, but even this he might do if he
felt but one of the points. To test the matter of errors of localization
I have made a few experiments in the Columbia University
laboratory. In order to be sure that the subject felt both
contacts I took two brass rods about four inches long, sharpened
one end and rounded off the other. The subject sat with
the palm of his right hand on the back of his left and his fingers
interlaced. I stimulated the back of his fingers on the second
phalanges with the sharp end of one rod and the blunt end of
the other and asked him to tell whether the sharp point was to
the right or to the left of the other. I will not give the results
in detail here, but only wish to mention a few things for the
purpose of illustrating the point in question. Many of the
<span class="pagenum">[140]</span><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>answers were wrong. Frequently the subject would say both
were on the same finger, when really they were on fingers of
opposite hands, which, however, in this position were adjacent
fingers. Sometimes when this happened I would ask him
which finger they were on, and after he had answered I would
leave the point on the finger on which he said both points were
and move the other point over to the same finger, then move it
back to its original position, then again over to the finger on
which the other point was resting, and so on, several times.
The subject would tell me that I was raising one point and
putting it down again in the same place all of the time. Often
a subject would tell me he felt both points on the same finger,
but that he could not tell to which hand the finger belonged.
When two or more fingers intervened between the fingers
touched no subject ever had any difficulty in telling which was
the sharp and which the blunt point, but when adjacent fingers
were touched it was very common for the subject to say he could
not tell which was which. This cannot be because there is
more difference in the quality of the contacts in one case than
in the other. If they were on the same finger it might be said
that they were stimulating the same general area, but since one
is on one hand and one on the other this is impossible. The
subject does not think the two points are in the same place,
because he feels two qualities and hence he infers two things,
and he knows two things cannot be in the same place at the
same time. If the two contacts were of the same quality probably
they would be perceived as one on account of the absence
of difference, for the absence of difference is precisely the
quality of oneness.</p>

<p>These facts, together with those mentioned before, seem to
me to indicate that errors of localization are largely responsible
for judgments which seem to be due to fusion or diffusion of
sensations. But they are responsible only in this way, they
prevent the correction of the first impression. I do not mean
that a person never changes his judgment after having once
made it, but a change of judgment is not necessarily a correction.
Often it is just the contrary. But where a wrong judgment
is made and cannot be corrected inability to localize is a
<span class="pagenum">[141]</span><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>prominent factor. This, however, is only a secondary factor
in the perception of number. The cardinal point seems to me
the following:</p>

<p>Any touch sensation, no matter by how many objects it is
produced, is one, and number is an inference based on a temporal
series of sensations. It may be that we can learn by association
to infer number immediately from the quality of a sensation,
but that means only that we recognize the sensation as one we
have had before and have found it convenient to separate into
parts and regard one part after the other, and we remember into
how many parts we separated it. This separating into parts is
a time process. What we shall regard as <i>one</i> is a mere matter
of convenience. Continuity sometimes affords a convenient
basis for unity and sometimes it does not. There is no standard
of oneness in the objective world. We separate things as far as
convenience or time permits and then stop and call that <i>one</i> which
our own attitude has determined shall be one.</p>

<p>That we do associate a sensation with whatever idea we
have previously connected it with, even though that idea be that
of the number of objects producing it, is clearly shown by some
experiments which I performed in the laboratory of Columbia
University. I took three little round pieces of wood and set
them in the form of a triangle. I asked the subject to pass his
right hand through a screen and told him I wanted to train him
to perceive one, two, three and four contacts at a time on the
back of his hand, and that I would tell him always how many
I gave him until he learned to do it. When it came to three I
gave him two points near the knuckles and one toward the
wrist and told him that was three. Then I turned the instrument
around and gave him one point near the knuckles and two
toward the wrist and told him that was four. As soon as he
was sure he distinguished all of the points I stopped telling him
and asked him to answer the number. I had four subjects, and
each one learned very soon to recognize the four contacts when
three were given in the manner mentioned above. I then repeated
the same thing on the left hand, except that I did not
tell him anything, but merely asked him to answer the number
of contacts he felt. In every case the idea of four was so
<span class="pagenum">[142]</span><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>firmly associated with that particular kind of a sensation that it
was still called four when given on the hand which had not
been trained. I gave each subject a diagram of his hand and
asked him to indicate the position of the points when three were
given and when four were given. This was done without difficulty.
Two subjects said they perceived the four contacts more
distinctly than the three, and two said they perceived the three
more distinctly than the four.</p>

<p>It seems very evident that the sensation produced by three
contacts is no more complex when interpreted as four than
when interpreted as three. If that is true, then it must also be
evident that the sensation produced by one contact is no more
complex when interpreted as two than when interpreted as one.
The converse should also be true, that the sensation produced
by two contacts is no less complex when interpreted as one
than when interpreted as two. Difference in number does not
indicate difference in complexity. The sensation of four is not
made up of four sensations of one. It is a unit as much as the
sensation of one is.</p>

<p>There remains but one point to be elaborated. If number
is not a quality of objects, but is merely a matter of attitude of
the subject, we should not expect to find a very clear-cut line
of demarcation between the different numbers except with regard
to those things which we constantly consider in terms of number.
Some of our associations are so firmly established and so
uniform that we are likely to regard them as necessary. It is
not so with our associations of number and touch sensations.
We have there only a vague, general notion of what the sensation
of one or two is, because usually it does not make much
difference to us, yet some sensations are so well established in
our minds that we call them one, two or four as the case may
be without hesitation. Other sensations are not so, and it is
difficult to tell to which class they belong. Just so it is easy to
tell a pure yellow color from a pure orange, yet they shade into
each other, so that it is impossible to tell where one leaves off
and the other begins. If we could speak of a one-two sensation
as we speak of a yellow-orange color we might be better able
to describe our sensations. It would, indeed, be convenient if
<span class="pagenum">[143]</span><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>we could call a sensation which seems like one with a suggestion
of two about it a two-one sensation, and one that seems
nearly like two but yet suggests one a one-two sensation. Since
we cannot do this, we must do the best we can and describe a
sensation in terms of the number it most strongly suggests.
Subjects very often, as has been mentioned before, describe a
sensation as 'more than one but less than two,' but when pressed
for an answer will say whichever number it most resembles.
A person would do the same thing if he were shown spectral
colors from orange to yellow and told to name each one either
orange or yellow. At one end he would be sure to say orange
and at the other yellow, but in the middle of the series his
answers would likely depend upon the order in which the colors
were shown, just as in determining the threshold for the perception
of two points by the method of minimal changes the answers
in the ascending series are not the same as those in the descending
series. The experiments have shown that the sensation
produced by two points, even when they are called one, is not
the same as that produced by only one point, but the difference
is not great enough to suggest a different number.</p>

<p>If the difference between one and two were determined by
the distance, then the substitution of lines for knobs of the
&aelig;sthesiometer ought to make no difference. And if the sensations
produced by two objects fuse when near together, then
the sensations produced by lines ought to fuse as easily as
those produced by knobs.</p>

<p>In regard to the higher numbers difficulties will arise unless
we take the same point of view and say that number is an inference
from a sensation which is in itself a unit. It has been
shown that four points across the ends of the fingers will be
called four or less, and that four points, one on the end of each
alternate finger and one at the base of each of the others, will
be called four or more&mdash;usually more. In either case each
contact is on a separate finger, and it is hardly reasonable to
suppose there is no diffusion when they are in a straight row,
but that when they are in irregular shape there is diffusion. It
is more probable that the subject regards the sensation produced
by the irregular arrangement as a novelty, and tries to
<span class="pagenum">[144]</span><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>separate it into parts. He finds both proximal and distal ends
of his fingers concerned. He may discover that the area
covered extends from his index to his little finger. He naturally
infers, judging from past experience, that it would take a good
many points to do that, and hence he overestimates the number.
When a novel arrangement was given, such as moving some of
the weights back on the wrist and scattering others over the
fingers, very little idea of number could be gotten, yet they
were certainly far enough apart to be felt one by one if a
person could ever feel them that way, and the number was not
so great as to be entirely unrecognizable.</p>

<h2><a name="PER5" id="PER5"></a>THE SUBJECTIVE HORIZON.</h2>

<h4>BY ROBERT MACDOUGALL.</h4>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>The general nature of the factors which enter into the
orientation of the main axes of our bodies, under normal and
abnormal conditions, has been of much interest to the psychologist
in connection with the problem of the development of space
and movement perception. The special points of attack in this
general investigation have comprised, firstly, the separation of
resident, or organic, from transient, or objective, factors; secondly,
the determination of the special organic factors which
enter into the mechanism of judgment and their several values;
and thirdly, within this latter field, the resolution of the problem
of a special mechanism of spatial orientation, the organ of the
static sense.</p>

<p>The special problem with which we are here concerned
relates to the group of factors upon which depends one's judgment
that any specified object within the visual field lies within
the horizontal plane of the eyes, or above or below that plane,
and the several functions and values of these components. The
method of procedure has been suggested by the results of preceding
investigations in this general field.</p>

<p>The first aim of the experiments was to separate the factors
of resident and transient sensation, and to determine the part
played by the presence of a diversified visual field. To do so
it was necessary to ascertain, for each member of the experimental
group, the location of the subjective visual horizon, and
the range of uncertainty in the observer's location of points
within that plane. Twelve observers in all took part in the investigation.
In the first set of experiments no attempt was made
to change the ordinary surroundings of the observer, except in
a single point, namely, the provision that there should be no
<span class="pagenum">[146]</span><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>extended object within range of the subject's vision having
horizontal lines on a level with his eyes.</p>

<p>The arrangements for experimentation were as follows: A
black wooden screen, six inches wide and seven feet high, was
mounted between two vertical standards at right angles to the
axis of vision of the observer. Vertically along the center of
this screen and over pulleys at its top and bottom passed a silk
cord carrying a disc of white cardboard, 1 cm. in diameter,
which rested against the black surface of the screen. From
the double pulley at the bottom of the frame the two ends of the
cord passed outward to the observer, who, by pulling one or the
other, could adjust the disc to any desired position. On the
opposite side of the screen from the observer was mounted a vertical
scale graduated in millimeters, over which passed a light
index-point attached to the silk cord, by means of which the
position of the cardboard disc in front was read off. The observer
was seated in an adjustable chair with chin and head
rests, and a lateral sighting-tube by which the position of the
eyeball could be vertically and horizontally aligned. The distance
from the center of the eyeball to the surface of the screen
opposite was so arranged that, neglecting the radial deflection, a
displacement of 1 mm. in either direction was equal to a departure
of one minute of arc from the plane of the eyes' horizon.</p>

<p>The observer sat with the light at his back, and by manipulation
of the cords adjusted the position of the white disc freely
up and down the screen until its center was judged to be on a
level with the eye. Its position was then read off the vertical
scale by the conductor (who sat hidden by an interposed screen),
and the error of judgment was recorded in degrees and fractions
as a positive (upward) or negative (downward) displacement.
The disc was then displaced alternately upward and
downward, and the judgment repeated. From the time of signalling
that the point had been located until this displacement
the observer sat with closed eyes. These determinations were
made in series of ten, and the individual averages are in general
based upon five such series, which included regularly the
results of sittings on different days. In some cases twice this
number of judgments were taken, and on a few occasions less.<span class="pagenum">[147]</span><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>
The number of judgments is attached to each series of figures
in the tables. In that which follows the individual values and
their general averages are given as minutes of arc for (<i>a</i>) the
constant error or position of the subjective horizon, (<i>b</i>) the average
deviation from the objective horizon, and (<i>c</i>) the mean variation
of the series of judgments.</p>

<p>The average subjective horizon shows a negative displacement,
the exceptional minority being large. No special facts
could be connected with this characteristic, either in method
of judgment or in the past habits of the reactor. The average
constant error is less than an eighth of a degree, and in neither
direction does the extreme reach the magnitude of a single degree
of arc. Since the mean variation is likewise relatively
small, there is indicated in one's ordinary judgments of this
kind a highly refined sense of bodily orientation in space.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>In order to separate the resident organic factors from those
presented by the fixed relations of the external world, an adaptation
of the mechanism was made for the purpose of carrying on
the observations in a darkened room. For the cardboard disc
was substituted a light carriage, riding upon rigid parallel vertical
wires and bearing a miniature ground-glass bulb enclosing
an incandescent electric light of 0.5 c.p. This was encased in
a chamber with blackened surfaces, having at its center an
aperture one centimeter in diameter, which was covered with
<span class="pagenum">[148]</span><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>white tissue paper. The subdued illumination of this disc
presented as nearly as possible the appearance of that used in
the preceding series of experiments. No other object than this
spot of moving light was visible to the observer. Adjustment
and record were made as before. The results for the same set
of observers as in the preceding case are given in the following
table:</p>

</table></div>

<p>Changes in two directions may be looked for in the results
as the experimental conditions are thus varied. The first is a
decrease in the certainty of judgment due to the simple elimination
of certain factors upon which the judgment depends.
The second is the appearance of definite types of error due
to the withdrawal of certain correctives of organic tendencies
which distort the judgment in specific directions. The loss
in accuracy is great; the mean variation increases from 7.69
to 31.43, or more than 400 per cent. This large increase must
not, however, be understood as indicating a simple reduction
in the observer's capacity to locate points in the horizontal
plane of the eyes. The two series are not directly comparable;
for in the case of the lighted room, since the whole visual background
remained unchanged, each determination must be conceived
to influence the succeeding judgment, which becomes
really a correction of the preceding. To make the two series
strictly parallel the scenery should have been completely
changed after each act of judgment. Nevertheless, a very
large increase of uncertainty may fairly be granted in passing
from a field of visual objects to a single illuminated point in an
otherwise dark field. It is probable that this change is largely
<span class="pagenum">[149]</span><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>due to the elimination of those elements of sensation depending
upon the relation of the sagittal axis to the plane against which
the object is viewed.</p>

<p>The change presented by the constant error can here be
interpreted only speculatively. I believe it is a frequently
noted fact that the lights in a distant house or other familiar
illuminated object on land, and especially the signal lights
on a vessel at sea appear higher than their respective positions
by day, to the degree at times of creating the illusion
that they hang suspended above the earth or water. This
falls in with the experimental results set forth in the preceding
table. It cannot be attributed to an uncomplicated tendency
of the eyes of a person seated in such a position to seek
a lower direction than the objective horizon, when freed from
the corrective restraint of a visual field, as will be seen when
the results of judgments made in complete darkness are cited,
in which case the direction of displacement is reversed. The
single illuminated spot which appears in the surrounding region
of darkness, and upon which the eye of the observer is directed
as he makes his judgment, in the former case restricts unconscious
wanderings of the eye, and sets up a process of continuous
and effortful fixation which accompanies each act of determination.
I attribute the depression of the eyes to this process
of binocular adjustment. The experience of strain in the act
of fixation increases and decreases with the distance of the object
regarded. In a condition of rest the axes of vision of the
eyes tend to become parallel; and from this point onward the
intensity of the effort accompanying the process of fixation increases
until, when the object has passed the near-point of
vision, binocular adjustment is no longer possible. In the general
distribution of objects in the visual field the nearer, for the
human being, is characteristically the lower, the more distant
the higher, as one looks in succession from the things at his
feet to the horizon and <i>vice versa</i>. We should, therefore, expect
to find, when the eyes are free to move in independence of
a determinate visual field, that increased convergence is accompanied
by a depression of the line of sight, decreased convergence
by an elevation of it. Here such freedom was permitted,
<span class="pagenum">[150]</span><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>and though the fixed distance of the point of regard eliminated
all large fluctuations in convergence, yet all the secondary
characteristics of intense convergence were present. Those
concerned in the experiment report that the whole process of
visual adjustment had increased in difficulty, and that the sense
of effort was distinctly greater. To this sharp rise in the general
sense of strain, in co&ouml;peration with the absence of a corrective
field of objects, I attribute the large negative displacement
of the subjective horizon in this series of experiments.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>In the next set of experiments the room was made completely
dark. The method of experimentation was adapted to
these new conditions by substituting for the wooden screen one
of black-surfaced cardboard, which was perforated at vertical
distances of five millimeters by narrow horizontal slits and circular
holes alternately, making a scale which was distinctly
readable at the distance of the observer. Opposite the end of
one of these slits an additional hole was punched, constituting a
fixed point from which distances were reckoned on the scale.
As the whole screen was movable vertically and the observer
knew that displacements were made from time to time, the succession
of judgments afforded no objective criterion of the range
of variation in the series of determinations, nor of the relation
of any individual reaction to the preceding. The method of
experimentation was as follows: The observer sat as before
facing the screen, the direction of which was given at the beginning
of each series by a momentary illumination of the
scale. In the darkness which followed the observer brought
the direction of sight, with open eyes, as satisfactorily as might
be into the plane of the horizontal, when, upon a simple signal,
the perforated scale was instantly and noiselessly illuminated by
the pressure of an electrical button, and the location of the point
of regard was read off the vertical scale by the observer himself,
in terms of its distance from the fixed point of origin described
above. The individual and general averages for this
set of experiments are given in the following table:<span class="pagenum">[151]</span><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></p>

<p>The point at which the eyes rest when seeking the plane of
the horizon in total darkness is above its actual position, the
positive displacement involved being of relatively large amount.</p>

<p>In addition to the removal of the whole diversified visual
field there has now been eliminated the final point of regard
toward which, in the preceding set of experiments, the sight
was strained; and the factor of refined visual adjustment ceases
longer to play a part in the phenomenon. The result of this
release is manifested in a tendency of the eyes to turn unconsciously
upward. This is their natural position when closed in
sleep. But this upward roll is not an uncomplicated movement.
There takes place at the same time a relaxation of binocular
convergence, which in sleep may be replaced by a slight divergence.
This tendency of the axes of vision to diverge as
the eyes are raised is undoubtedly connected biologically with
the distribution of distances in the higher and lower parts of the
field of vision, of which mention has already been made. Its
persistence is taken advantage of in the artificial device of assisting
the process of stereoscopic vision without instruments by
holding the figures to be viewed slightly above the primary position,
so that the eyes must be raised in order to look at them
and their convergence thereby decreased. It is by the concomitance
of these two variables that the phenomena of both
this and the preceding series of experiments are to be explained.
In the present case the elimination of a fixed point of regard is
followed by a release of the mechanism of convergence, with a
consequent approximation to parallelism in the axes of vision
and its concomitant elevation of the line of sight.<span class="pagenum">[152]</span><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a></p>

<p>The second fact to be noted is the reduction in amount of the
mean variation. The series of values under the three sets
of experimental conditions hitherto described is as follows:
I. 7'.69; II. 31'.42; III. 17'.16. This increase of regularity
I take to be due, as in the case of the lighted room, to the
presence of a factor of constancy which is not strictly an element
in the judgment of horizontality. This is a system of
sensory data, which in the former case were transient&mdash;the vision
of familiar objects; and in the latter resident&mdash;the recognition
of specific experiences of strain in the mechanism of the eye.
The latter sensations exist under all three sets of conditions, but
they are of secondary importance in those cases which include
the presence of an objective point of regard, while in the case
of judgments made in total darkness the observer depends solely
upon resident experiences. Attention is thus directed specifically
toward these immediate sensational elements of judgment,
and there arises a tendency to reproduce the preceding set of
eye-strains, instead of determining the horizon plane afresh at
each act of judgment upon more general data of body position.</p>

<p>If the act of judgment be based chiefly upon sensory data
connected with the reinstatement of the preceding set of strains,
progressions should appear in these series of judgments, provided
a constant factor of error be incorporated in the process.
This deflection should be most marked under conditions of complete
darkness, least in the midst of full illumination. Such
a progression would be shown at once by the distribution
of positive and negative values of the individual judgments
about the indifference point of constant error. As instances
of its occurrence all cases have been counted in which
the first half of the series of ten judgments was uniformly of
one sign (four to six being counted as half) and the second
half of the opposite sign. The percentages of cases in which
the series presented such a progression are as follows: In diffused
light, 7.6%; in darkness, point of regard illuminated,
18.3%; in complete darkness, 26.1%. The element of constant
error upon which such progressions depend is the tendency
of the eye to come to rest under determinate mechanical conditions
of equilibrium of muscular strain.<span class="pagenum">[153]</span><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a></p>

<p>The relation of the successive judgments of a series to the
reinstatement of specific eye-strains and to the presence of an
error of constant tendency becomes clearer when the distribution
of those series which show progression is analyzed simultaneously
with reference to conditions of light and darkness and to
binocular and monocular vision respectively. Their quantitative
relations are presented in the following table:</p>

<h5>TABLE IV.</h5>

<div class="center"><table  border="0" width="60%" cellspacing="5" summary="TABLE IV">
<colgroup span="4"><col align="left" /><col span="3" align="center" /></colgroup>
<tr><th>Illumination.</th><th>Per Cent.Showing Progress.</th><th>Binocular.</th><th>Monocular.</th></tr>
<tr><td>In light.</td><td>7.6 %</td><td>50 %</td><td>50 %</td></tr>
<tr><td>In darkness.</td><td>18.3</td><td>34.2</td><td>65.8</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>Among judgments made in daylight those series which present
progression are equally distributed between binocular and
monocular vision. When, however, the determinations are of
a luminous point in an otherwise dark field, the preponderance
in monocular vision of the tendency to a progression becomes
pronounced. That this is not a progressive rectification of the
judgment, is made evident by the distribution of the directions
of change in the several experimental conditions shown in the
following table:</p>

<h5>TABLE V.</h5>

<div class="center"><table  border="0" width="60%" cellspacing="5" summary="TABLE V">
<colgroup span="5"><col align="left" /><col span="4" align="left" /></colgroup>
<tr><th></th><th colspan="2" align="center">Light.</th><th colspan="2" align="center">Darkness.</th></tr>
<tr><th>Direction of Change.</th><th>Binocular.</th><th>Monocular.</th><th>Binocular.</th><th>Monocular.</th></tr>
<tr><td>Upward.</td><td>50 %</td><td>100 %</td><td>38.4 %</td><td>65.0 %</td></tr>
<tr><td>Downward.</td><td>50</td><td>00.0</td><td>61.6</td><td>35.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Const. Err.</td><td>-7.70</td><td>+11.66</td><td>-36.62</td><td>-3.38</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>When the visual field is illuminated the occurrence of progression
in binocular vision is accidental, the percentages being
equally distributed between upward and downward directions.
In monocular vision, on the contrary, the movement is uniformly
upward and involves a progressive increase in error. When
the illuminated point is exposed in an otherwise dark field the
progression is preponderatingly downward in binocular vision
and upward in vision with the single eye. The relation of
these changes to phenomena of convergence, and the tendency
to upward rotation in the eyeball has already been stated.
There is indicated, then, in these figures the complication of
the process of relocating the ideal horizon by reference to the
<span class="pagenum">[154]</span><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>sense of general body position with tendencies to reinstate simply
the set of eye-muscle strains which accompanied the preceding
judgment, and the progressive distortion of the latter by a
factor of constant error due to the mechanical conditions of muscular
equilibrium in the resting eye.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>The influence of this factor is also exhibited when judgments
made with both eyes are compared with those made under conditions
of monocular vision. The latter experiments were carried
on in alternate series with those already described. The
figures are given in the following tables:</p>

<p>The plane of vision in judgments made with the right eye
alone is deflected upward from the true horizon to a greater
<span class="pagenum">[155]</span><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>degree than it is depressed below it in those made with binocular
vision, the respective values of the constant errors being
-7'.70 and +11'.66, a difference of 19'.36. When the field
of vision is darkened except for the single illuminated disc, a
similar reversion of sign takes place in the constant error.
With binocular vision the plane of the subjective horizon is deflected
downward through 36'.62 of arc; with monocular vision
it is elevated 3'.38, a difference of 40'.00, or greater than in the
case of judgments made in the lighted room by 20'.64. This
increase is to be expected in consequence of the elimination of
those corrective criteria which the figured visual field presents.
The two eyes do not, of course, function separately in such a
case, and the difference in the two sets of results is undoubtedly
due to the influence of movements in the closed eye upon that
which is open; or rather, to the difference in binocular functioning
caused by shutting off the visual field from one eye.
The former expression is justified in so far as we conceive that
the tendency of the closed eye to turn slightly upward in its
socket affects also the direction of regard in the open eye by
attracting toward itself its plane of vision. But if, as has been
pointed out, this elevation of the line of sight in the closed eye
is accompanied by a characteristic change in the process of binocular
convergence, the result cannot be interpreted as a
simple sympathetic response in the open eye to changes taking
place in that which is closed, but is the consequence of a release
of convergence strain secondarily due to this act of closing
the eye.</p>

<p>Several points of comparison between judgments made with
binocular and with monocular vision remain to be stated. In
general, the process of location is more uncertain when one eye
only is used than when both are employed, but this loss in
accuracy is very slight and in many cases disappears. The loss
in accuracy is perhaps also indicated by the range of variation
in the two cases, its limits being for binocular vision +46'.29
to -56'.70, and for monocular +62'.30 to -61'.10, an increase
of 20'.41. In the darkened room similar relations are presented.
The mean variations are as follows: binocular vision,
31'.42; monocular, 32'.17. Its limits in individual judgments
<span class="pagenum">[156]</span><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>are: binocular, -1'.62 to -128'.70, monocular, +66'.38 to
-71'.06, an increase of 10'.36. In all ways, then, the difference
in accuracy between the two forms of judgment is extremely
small, and the conclusion may be drawn that those significant
factors of judgment which are independent of the figuration of
the visual field are not connected with the stereoscopic functioning
of the two eyes, but such as are afforded by adjustment in
the single eye and its results.</p>

<p>The experimental conditions were next complicated by the
introduction of abnormal positions of the eyes, head and whole

<p>The errors which appear in these tables are not consistently
of the type presented in the well-known rotation of visual planes
subjectively determined under conditions of abnormal relations
of the head or body in space. When the head is rotated upward
on its lateral horizontal axis the average location of the
<span class="pagenum">[157]</span><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>subjective horizon, though still depressed below the true objective,
is higher than when rotation takes place in the opposite
direction. When the whole body is rotated backward through
45&deg; a positive displacement of large amount takes place in the
case of all observers. When the rotation extends to 90&deg;, the body
now reclining horizontally but with the head supported in a raised
position to allow of free vision, an upward displacement occurs
in the case of one of the two observers, and in that of the other
a displacement in the opposite direction. When change of
position takes place in the head only, the mean variation is
decidedly greater if the rotation be upward than if it be downward,
its value in the former case being above, in the latter below
that of the normal. When the whole body is rotated backward
through 45&deg; the mean variation is but slightly greater
than under normal conditions; when the rotation is through 90&deg;
it is much less. A part of this reduction is probably due to training.
In general, it may be said that the disturbance of the normal
body relations affects the location of the subjective horizon, but
the specific nature and extent of this influence is left obscure by
these experiments. The ordinary movements of eyes and head
are largely independent of one another, and even when closed
the movements of the eyes do not always symmetrically follow
those of the head. The variations in the two processes have
been measured by M&uuml;nsterberg and Campbell<a name="FNanchor_1_67" id="FNanchor_1_67"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_1_67'>1</a> in reference to a
single condition, namely, the relation of attention to and interest
in the objects observed to the direction of sight in the closed
eyes after movement of the head. But apart from the influence
of such secondary elements of ideational origin, there is reason
to believe that the mere movement of the head from its normal
position on the shoulders up or down, to one side or the other,
is accompanied by compensatory motion of the eyes in an opposite
direction, which tends to keep the axis of vision nearer
to the primary position. When the chin is elevated or depressed,
this negative reflex adjustment is more pronounced and constant
than when the movement is from side to side. In the majority
of cases the retrograde movement of the eyes does not equal
the head movement in extent, especially if the latter be extreme.</p>

<p>The origin of such compensatory reactions is connected with
the permanent relations of the whole bodily organism to the
important objects which surround it. The relations of the
body to the landscape are fairly fixed. The objects which it is
important to watch lie in a belt which is roughly on a horizontal
plane with the observing eye. They move or are moved
about over the surface of the ground and do not undergo any
large vertical displacement. It is of high importance, therefore,
that the eye should be capable of continuous observation
of such objects through facile response to the stimulus of their
visual appearance and movements, in independence of the
orientation of the head. There are no such determinate spatial
relations between body position and the world of important
visual objects in the case of those animals which are immersed
in a free medium; and in the organization of the fish and the
bird, therefore, one should not expect the development of such
free sensory reflexes of the eye in independence of head movements
as we know to be characteristic of the higher land
vertebrates. In both of the former types the eye is fixed in its
socket, movements of the whole head or body becoming the
mechanism of adjustment to new objects of observation. In
the adjustment of the human eye the reflex determination
through sensory stimuli is so facile as to counteract all ordinary
movements of the head, the gaze remaining fixed upon
the object through a series of minute and rapidly repeated sensory
reflexes. When the eyes are closed and no such visual
stimuli are presented, similar reflexes take place in response to
the movements of the head, mediated possibly by sensations
connected with changes in position of the planes of the semicircular
canals.</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>If eye-strain be a significant element in the process of determining
the subjective horizon, the induction of a new center of
muscular equilibrium by training the eyes to become accustomed
to unusual positions should result in the appearance of characteristic
errors of displacement. In the case of two observers,
<i>A</i> and <i>H</i>, the eyes were sharply raised or lowered for eight
<span class="pagenum">[158]</span><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>seconds before giving judgment as to the position of the illuminated
spot, which was exposed at the moment when the eyes
were brought back to the primary position. The effect of any
such vertical rotation is to stretch the antagonistic set of muscles.
It follows that when the eye is rotated in the contrary direction
the condition of equilibrium appears sooner than in normal
vision. In the case of both observers the subjective horizon
was located higher when judgment was made after keeping the
eyes raised, and lower when the line of sight had been depressed.
In the case of only one observer was a quantitative
estimation of the error made, as follows: With preliminary
raising of the eyes the location was +36'.4; with preliminary
lowering, -11'.4.</p>

<p>When the illuminated button is exposed in a darkened room
and is fixated by the observer, it undergoes a variety of changes
in apparent position due to unconscious shifting of the point of
regard, the change in local relations of the retinal stimulation
being erroneously attributed to movements in the object. These
movements were not of frequent enough occurrence to form the
basis of conclusions as to the position at which the eyes tended
to come to a state of rest. The number reported was forty-two,
and the movement observed was rather a wandering than an
approximation toward a definite position of equilibrium. The
spot very rarely presented the appearance of sidewise floating,
but this may have been the result of a preconception on the part
of the observer rather than an indication of a lessened liability
to movements in a horizontal plane. Objective movements in
the latter direction the observer knew to be impossible, while
vertical displacements were expected. Any violent movement
of the head or eyes dispelled the impression of floating at once.
The phenomenon appeared only when the illuminated spot had
been fixated for an appreciable period of time. Its occurrence
appears to be due to a fatigue process in consequence of which
the mechanism becomes insensible to slight changes resulting
from releases among the tensions upon which constant fixation
depends. When the insensitiveness of fatigue is avoided by a
slow continuous change in the position of the illuminated spot,
no such wandering of the eye from its original point of regard
<span class="pagenum">[160]</span><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>occurs, and the spot does not float. The rate at which such
objective movements may take place without awareness on the
part of the observer is surprisingly great. Here the fatigue due
to sustained fixation is obviated by the series of rapid and slight
sensory reflexes which take place; these have the effect of
keeping unchanged the retinal relations of the image cast by
the illuminated spot, and being undiscriminated in the consciousness
of the observer the position of the point of regard is
apprehended by him as stationary. The biological importance
of such facile and unconscious adjustment of the mechanism of
vision to the moving object needs no emphasis; but the relation
of these obscure movements of the eyes to the process of determining
the plane of the subjective horizon should be pointed
out. The sense of horizontality in the axes of vision is a transient
experience, inner conviction being at its highest in the first
moments of perception and declining so characteristically from
this maximum that in almost every case the individual judgment
long dwelt upon is unsatisfactory to the observer. This change
I conceive to be a secondary phenomenon due to the appearance
of the visual wanderings already described.</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>The influence of sensory reflexes in the eye upon the
process of visual orientation was next taken up in connection
with two specific types of stimulation. At top and bottom of
the vertical screen were arranged dark lanterns consisting of
electric bulbs enclosed in blackened boxes, the fronts of which
were covered with a series of sheets of white tissue-paper, by
which the light was decentralized and reduced in intensity, and
of blue glass, by which the yellow quality of the light was
neutralized. Either of these lanterns could be illuminated at
will by the pressure of a button. All other experimental conditions
remained unchanged. The observers were directed to
pay no special regard to these lights, and the reports show
that in almost every case they had no conscious relation to
the judgment. The results are presented in the following
table:<span class="pagenum">[161]</span><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a></p>

<p>The eye is uniformly attracted toward the light and the
location of the disk correspondingly elevated or depressed. The
amount of displacement which appears is relatively large. It
will be found to vary with the intensity, extent and distance of
the illuminated surfaces introduced. There can be little doubt
that the practical judgments of life are likewise affected by the
distribution of light intensities, and possibly also of significant
objects, above and below the horizon belt. Every brilliant
object attracts the eye toward itself; and the horizon beneath a
low sun or moon will be found to be located higher than in a
clouded sky. The upper half of the ordinary field of view&mdash;the
clear sky&mdash;is undiversified and unimportant; the lower half
is full of objects and has significance. We should probably be
right in attributing to these characteristic differences a share in
the production of the negative error of judgment which appears
in judgments made in daylight. The introduction of such supplementary
stimuli appears to have little effect upon the regularity
of the series of judgments, the values of the mean variations
being relatively low: 17'.42 with light below, 17'.74 with
it above.</p>

<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>In the final series of experiments the influence of limiting
visual planes upon the determination of the subjective horizon
was taken up. It had been noticed by Dr. M&uuml;nsterberg in the
course of travel in hill country that a curious negative displacement
of the subjective horizon took place when one looked
across a downward slope to a distant cliff, the altitude (in relation
to the observer's own standpoint) of specific points on the
wall of rock being largely overestimated. Attributing the illusion
<span class="pagenum">[162]</span><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>to a reconstruction of the sensory data upon an erroneous
interpretation of the objective relations of the temporary plane
of the landscape, Dr. M&uuml;nsterberg later made a series of rough
experiments by stretching an inclined cord from the eye downward
to a lower point on an opposite wall and estimating the
height above its termination of that point which appeared to be
on a level with the observing eye. He found an illusion present
similar to the case of an extended slope of country.</p>

<p>The first experiments of this group repeated those just described.
The previous mechanical conditions were varied only
by the introduction of a slender cord which was stretched from
just below the eyes to the bottom of the vertical screen. Full
results were obtained from only two observers, which are given
in the following table:</p>

<p>The effect of introducing such an objective plane of reference
is twofold: the mean variation is increased, and the
plane of the subjective horizon is displaced downwards. First,
then, it acts as a simple factor of disturbance; it distracts from
those habitual adjustments upon which the accuracy of the
judgment depends. Secondly, it enters as a source of constant
error into the determination of the subjective horizon, which is
attracted toward this new objective plane. In the third section
of the table are given the results of judgments made in the presence
of such a plane but without conscious reference to it.<a name="FNanchor_2_68" id="FNanchor_2_68"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_2_68'>2</a> The
figures here are of intermediate value in the case of the mean
<span class="pagenum">[163]</span><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>variation and of slightly greater value than the first in that of
the constant error. In other words, the introduction of such a
plane cannot be wholly overlooked, though it may be greatly
abstracted from.</p>

<p>The single cord was next replaced by a plane of blackened
wood six inches wide and extending from the observer to the
vertical screen. This strip was arranged in two ways: first,
from the observer's chin to the bottom of the screen, and secondly,
from the feet of the observer to a point on the screen a
short distance below the plane of the objective horizon. The
individual and average results are given in the following table:</p>

<p>The introduction of a descending plane lowers the apparent
horizon; that of an ascending plane elevates it. The general
disturbance of judgment appears distinctly greater in the case
of a downward than in that of an upward incline.</p>

<p>The results of a third variation of the experimental conditions
may be presented at once. In it the location of the subjective
horizon under normal conditions was compared with the
results of adjustments made when the screen bearing the white
disc was rotated backward from the observer through an angle
of varying magnitude. The averages for each of the two subjects
are as follows:</p>

<p>These experiments were carried on in the presence of the
definitely figured visual field of the lighted room, and the observers
were conscious of taking these permanent features into
account as correctives in making their judgments. Before proceeding,
<span class="pagenum">[164]</span><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>this defect was remedied as far as possible by enclosing
the apparatus of experimentation, including the observer,
between two walls of black fabric. Nothing was to be seen but
these two walls, and the inclined plane which terminated the
observer's view. The position of the screen remained constant
at an inclination of 45&deg;. The upper bounding lines of the
enclosing walls, on the contrary, were adjusted in three different
relations to the plane of the gravity horizon. In the first
arrangement these lines were horizontal; in the second the ends
next to the observer were depressed five degrees; while in the
final arrangement these ends were elevated through a like
angular distance.</p>

<p>The inclined position of the screen was of course observed
by every reactor, but of the changes in the enclosing walls no
subject was informed, and none discerned them on any occasion.
Each observer was questioned as to alterations in the
experimental conditions after the use of each arrangement, and
at the close of the whole series inquiry was made of each as to
the planes of the upper boundaries of the walls. On various
occasions, but not customarily, the observer was aware of a
change of some kind in the whole set of conditions, but the particular
feature altered was not suspected. The results for all
three arrangements are given in the following table; of the sections
of this table the third is incomplete, full results having
been reached in the cases of only three observers:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[165]</span><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>For every individual observer, the position of the disc on
the screen has been affected by each change in the direction
of these visible lines. In every case, also, its location when
these boundaries lay in a horizontal plane was intermediate
between the other two. The importance of such relations
in the objects of the visual field as factors in our ordinary
determination of the subjective horizon is made evident by
these experimental results. They become construction lines
having assumed permanence in the world of visual-motor
experience. The conception of unchanging spatial relations
in the fundamental lines of perspective vision receives constant
reinforcement from the facts of daily experience. The
influence of the above-described changes in experimental conditions
is mediated through their effect upon the location of the
focus of the limiting and perspective lines of vision. As the
plane of the upper boundaries of the enclosing walls was
elevated and depressed the intersection of the two systems of
lines was correspondingly raised and lowered, and in dependence
upon the location of this imaginary point the determination
of the position of the white disc was made, and the plane of
perspective positively or negatively rotated.</p>

<p>Why such perspective lines should enter into the process of
judgment it is not difficult to infer. The plane of perspective
for human beings is characteristically horizontal, in consequence
of the distribution of important objects within the field
of visual perception. Roughly, the belt of the earth's horizon
contains the loci of all human perspective planes. Both natural
and artificial arrangements of lines converge there. The systems
of visual objects on the earth and in the sky are there
broken sharply off in virtue of their practically vast differences
in quality and significance for the observer. The latter perspective
probably never extends downward illusorily to points
on the earth's surface; and the former system of objects is
carried continuously upward to skyey points only on relatively
rare occasions, as when one mistakes clouds for mountains or
the upper edge of a fog-belt on the horizon for the rim of sea
and sky. The point of convergence of the fundamental lines
of perspective thus becomes assimilated with the idea of the
<span class="pagenum">[166]</span><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>visual horizon, as that concept has fused with the notion of a
subjective horizon. There can be little doubt that the disposition
of such lines enters constantly into our bodily orientation in
space along with sensations arising from the general body position
and from those organs more specially concerned with the
static sense.</p>

<p>Upon the misinterpretation of such objective planes depends
the illusion of underestimation of the height or incline of a hill
one is breasting, and of the converse overestimation of one seen
across a descending slope or intervening valley. The latter
illusion is especially striking, and in driving over forest roads
(in which case the correction of a wider range of view is excluded)
the stretch of level ground at the foot of a hill one is
descending is constantly mistaken for an opposing rise. This
illusion is put into picturesque words by Stevenson when he
describes the world, seen from the summit of a mountain upon
which one stands, as rising about him on every side as toward
the rim of a great cup. The fitness of the image may be
proved by climbing the nearest hill. In all such cases a reconstruction
of the sensory data of judgment takes place, in
which the most significant factor is the plane determined by the
positions of the observing eye and the perspective focus. In
these judgments of spatial relationship, as they follow one
another from moment to moment, this plane becomes a temporary
subjective horizon, and according as it is positively or negatively
rotated do corresponding illusions of perception appear.</p>

<h2><a name="PER6" id="PER6"></a>THE ILLUSION OF RESOLUTION-STRIPES ON
THE COLOR-WHEEL.</h2>

<h3>BY EDWIN B. HOLT.</h3>


<p>If a small rod is passed slowly before a rotating disc composed
of two differently colored sectors, the rod appears to leave
behind it on the disc a number of parallel bands of about the
width of the rod and of about the colors, alternately arranged,
of the two sectors. These appear not to move, but gradually
to fade away.</p>

<p>This phenomenon was first observed by M&uuml;nsterberg, and
by him shown to Jastrow,<a name="FNanchor_1_69" id="FNanchor_1_69"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_1_69'>1</a> who, with Moorehouse, has printed a
study, without, however, offering an adequate explanation of it.</p>

<h3>I. APPARATUS FOR PRODUCING THE ILLUSION.</h3>

<p>Any form of color-wheel may be used, but preferably one
which is driven by electricity or clock-work, so that a fairly
constant speed is assured. Several pairs of paper discs are
needed, of the ordinary interpenetrating kind which permit a
ready readjustment of the ratios between the two sectors, as follows:
one pair consisting of a white and a black disc, one of
a light-and a dark-colored disc (light green and dark red have
been found admirably suited to the purpose), and a pair of discs
distinctly different in color, but equal in luminosity.</p>

<p>The rod should be black and not more than a quarter of an
inch broad. It may be passed before the rotating disc by hand.
For the sake of more careful study, however, the rod should be
moved at a constant rate by some mechanical device, such as the
pendulum and works of a Maelzel metronome removed from
their case. The pendulum is fixed just in front of the color-disc.
A further commendable simplification of the conditions
consists in arranging the pendulum and disc to move concentrically,
<span class="pagenum">[168]</span><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>and attaching to the pendulum an isosceles-triangular
shield, so cut that it forms a true radial sector of the disc behind
it. All the colored bands of the illusion then appear as
radial sectors. The radial shields should be made in several
sizes (from 3 to 50 degrees of arc) in black, but the smallest
size should also be prepared in colors matching the several discs.
Such a disposition, then, presents a disc of fused color, rotating
at a uniform rate, and in front of this a radial sector
oscillating from side to side concentrically with the disc, and
likewise at a uniform rate. Several variations of this apparatus
will be described as the need and purpose of them become clear.</p>

<h3>II. PREVIOUS DISCUSSION OF THE ILLUSION.</h3>

<p>Although Jastrow and Moorehouse (<i>op. cit.</i>) have published
a somewhat detailed study of these illusion-bands, and
cleared up certain points, they have not explained them. Indeed,
no explanation of the bands has as yet been given. The
authors mentioned (<i>ibid.</i>, <a href="#Page_204">p. 204</a>) write of producing the illusion
by another method. &quot;This consists in sliding two half discs
of the same color over one another leaving an open sector of
any desired size up to 180 degrees and rotating this against a
background of a markedly different color, in other words we
substitute for the disc composed of a large amount of one color,
which for brevity we may call the 'majority color,' and a small
amount of another, the 'minority color,' one in which the second
color is in the background and is viewed through an opening
in the first. With such an arrangement we find that we get the
series of bands both when the wire is passed in front of the disc
and when passed in back between disc and background; and
further experimentation shows that the time relations of the
two are the same. (There is, of course, no essential difference
between the two methods when the wire is passed in front of the
disc.)&quot; That is true, but it is to be borne in mind that there is
a difference when the wire is passed behind the disc, as these
authors themselves state (<i>loc. cit.</i>, note):&mdash;&quot;The time-relations
in the two cases are the same, but the <i>color-phenomena</i>
considerably <i>different</i>.&quot; However, &quot;these facts enable us to
formulate our first generalization, viz., that for all purposes
<span class="pagenum">[169]</span><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>here relevant [<i>i.e.</i>, to a study of the <i>time-relations</i>] the seeing
of a wire now against one background and then immediately
against another is the same as its now appearing and then disappearing;
a rapid succession of changed appearances is equivalent
to a rapid alternation of appearance and disappearance.
Why this is so we are unable to say,&quot; etc. These authors now
take the first step toward explaining the illusion. In their
words (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 205), &quot;the suggestion is natural that we
are dealing with the phenomena of after-images.... If this is the true
explanation of the fact that several rods are seen, then we
should, with different rotation rates of disc and rod, see as
many rods as multiplied by the time of one rotation of the disc
would yield a constant, <i>i.e.</i>, the time of an after image
of the kind under consideration.&quot; For two subjects, J.J. and G.M.,
the following tabulation was made.</p>

<div class="center"><table summary="Rotation Times" width="75%">
<colgroup span="5"><col span="3" align="center" /><col span="2" align="left" /></colgroup>
<tr><td colspan="3"></td><th>J.J.</th><th>G.M.</th></tr>
<tr><td>Av. time of rot. of disc when</td><td>2</td><td>images of rod were seen</td><td>.0812 sec.</td><td>.0750 sec.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;</td><td>3</td><td>&quot;</td><td>.0571</td><td>.0505</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;</td><td>4</td><td>&quot;</td><td>.0450</td><td>.0357</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;</td><td>5</td><td>&quot;</td><td>.0350</td><td>.0293</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;</td><td>6</td><td>&quot;</td><td>.0302</td><td>.0262</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>&quot;Multiplying the number of rods by the rotation rate we
get for J.J. an average time of after image of .1740 sec. (a
little over 1/6 sec.) with an average deviation of .0057 (3.2%);
for G.M. .1492 (a little over 1/7 sec.) with an average deviation
of .0036 (2.6%). An independent test of the time of after-image
of J.J. and G.M. by observing when a black dot on
a rotating white disc just failed to form a ring resulted in
showing in every instance a longer time for the former than for the
latter.&quot; That this constant product of the number of 'rods'
seen by the time of one rotation of the disc equals the duration
of after-image of the rod is established, then, only by inference.
More indubitable, since directly measured on two
subjects, is the statement that that person will see more 'rods'
whose after-image persists longer. This result the present
writer fully confirms. What relation the 'constant product'
bears to the duration of after-image will be spoken of later.
But aside from all measurement, a little consideration of the
conditions obtaining when the rod is passed <i>behind</i> the disc will
<span class="pagenum">[170]</span><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>convince any observer that the bands are indeed after-images
somehow dependent on the rod. We may account it established
that <i>the bands are after-images</i>.</p>

<p>From this beginning one might have expected to find in the
paper of Jastrow and Moorehouse a complete explanation of the
illusion. On other points, however, these authors are less
explicit. The changes in width of the bands corresponding to
different sizes of the sectors and different rates of movement
for the rod and disc, are not explained, nor yet, what is more
important, the color-phenomena. In particular the fact needs
to be explained, that the moving rod analyzes the apparently
homogeneous color of the disc; or, as Jastrow and Moorehouse
state it (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 202): &quot;If two rotating discs were presented
to us, the one pure white in color, and the other of ideally
perfect spectral colors in proper proportion, so as to give a precisely
similar white, we could not distinguish between the two;
but by simply passing a rod in front of them and observing in
the one case but not in the other the parallel rows of colored
bands, we could at once pronounce the former to be composite,
and the latter simple. In the indefinitely brief moment during
which the rod interrupts the vision of the disc, the eye obtains
an impression sufficient to analyze to some extent into its elements
this rapid mixture of stimuli.&quot; The very question is as
to <i>how</i> the eye obtains the 'impression sufficient to analyze' the
mixture.</p>

<p>It may be shown at this point that the mistake of these
authors lies in their recognition of but one set of bands, namely
(<i>ibid.</i>, p. 201), 'bands of a color similar to that present in
greater proportion' on the disc. But, on the other hand, it is to
be emphasized that those bands are separated from one another,
not by the fused color of the disc, as one should infer from the
article, but by <i>other bands</i>, which are, for their part, of a color
similar to that present in <i>lesser</i> proportion. Thus, bands of the
two colors alternate; and either color of band is with equal
ease to be distinguished from the fused color of the main portion
of the disc.</p>

<p>Why our authors make this mistake is also clear. They
first studied the illusion with the smaller sector of the disc open,
<span class="pagenum">[171]</span><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>and the rod moving behind it; and since in this case the bands
are separated by strips not of the minority but of the fused color,
and are of about the width of the rod itself, these authors came
to recognize bands of but one sort, and to call these 'images of
the rod.' But now, with the rod moving in front of the disc,
there appear bands of two colors alternately disposed, and
neither of these colors is the fused color of the disc. Rather
are these two colors approximately the majority and minority
colors of the disc as seen at rest. Thus, the recognition of but
one set of bands and the conclusion (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 208) that 'the
bands originate during the vision of the minority color,' are
wholly erroneous. The bands originate as well during the
vision of the majority color, and, as will later be shown, the
process is continuous.</p>

<p>Again, it is incorrect, even in the case of those bands seen
behind the open sector, to call the bands 'images of the rod,'
for images of the rod would be of the color of the rod, whereas,
as our authors themselves say (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 201), the bands 'are of
a color similar to that present in greater proportion' on the disc.
Moreover the 'images of the rod' are of the most diverse
widths. In fact, we shall find that the width of the rod is but
one of several factors which determine the width of its 'images,'
the bands.</p>

<p>Prejudiced by the same error is the following statement
(<i>ibid.</i>, p. 208): &quot;With the majority color darker than the
minority color the bands are darker than the resulting mixture,
and lighter when the majority color is the lighter.&quot; If this is
to be true, one must read for 'the bands,' 'the narrower
bands.'</p>

<p>Another observation found in this article must be criticised.
It is asserted that difference of shade between the two sectors of
the disc, as well as difference of color, is essential to the
illusion. To support this, four cases are given: two in which
the sectors were so similar in luminosity as to bring out the
illusion but faintly; two in which like luminosities yielded no
illusion at all. The present writer agrees that if the two sectors
are closely similar in luminosity, the illusion is fainter. He
also selected a red and a green so near each other in brightness
<span class="pagenum">[172]</span><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>that when a rod 4 mm. broad (which is the largest rod that Jastrow
and Moorehouse mention having used) was passed by hand
before the disc, no trace of a band could be seen. The pendulum,
however, bearing a shield considerably wider than 4 mm.
(say of 15 degrees) and moving before the very same red and
green shades, mixed in the same proportions, yielded the illusion
with the utmost clearness. Colors of like luminosities yield
the illusion less strikingly, nevertheless they yield it.</p>

<p>Again (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 205), these authors say: &quot;It has
been already observed that the distance between the bands
diminishes as the rotation rate and the rate of movement of the
rod increases.&quot; But what had been said before is (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 203)
that 'the bands are separated by smaller and smaller
spaces as the rate of movement of the rod becomes slower and
slower'; and this is equivalent to saying that the distance
between the bands diminishes as the rate of movement of the
rod decreases. The statements are contradictory. But there is
no doubt as to which is the wrong one&mdash;it is the first. What
these authors have called 'distance between the bands' has
here been shown to be itself a band. Now, no point about this
illusion can be more readily observed than that the widths of
both kinds of band vary directly with the speed of the rod,
inversely, however (as Jastrow and Moorehouse have noted),
with the speed of the disc.</p>

<p>Perhaps least satisfactory of all is their statement (<i>ibid.</i>,
p. 206) that &quot;A brief acquaintance with the illusion sufficed to
convince us that its appearance was due to contrast of some
form, though the precise nature of this contrast is the most difficult
point of all.&quot; The present discussion undertakes to explain
with considerable minuteness every factor of the illusion, yet
the writer does not see how in any essential sense contrast
could be said to be involved.</p>

<p>With the other observations of these authors, as that the
general effect of an increase in the width of the interrupting rod
was to render the illusion less distinct and the bands wider, etc.,
the observations of the present writer fully coincide. These
will systematically be given later, and we may now drop the
discussion of this paper.<span class="pagenum">[173]</span><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a></p>

<p>The only other mention to be found of these resolution-bands
is one by Sanford,<a name="FNanchor_2_70" id="FNanchor_2_70"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_2_70'>2</a> who says, apparently merely reiterating the
results of Jastrow and Moorehouse, that the illusion is probably
produced by the sudden appearance, by contrast, of the rod as
the lighter sector passes behind it, and by its relative disappearance
as the dark sector comes behind. He thus compares
the appearance of several rods to the appearance of several dots
in intermittent illumination of the strobic wheel. If this were
the correct explanation, the bands could not be seen when both
sectors were equal in luminosity; for if both were dark, the rod
could never appear, and if both were light, it could never disappear.
The bands can, however, be seen, as was stated
above, when both the sectors are light or both are dark.
Furthermore, this explanation would make the bands to be of
the same color as the rod. But they are of other colors.
Therefore Sanford's explanation cannot be admitted.</p>

<p>And finally, the suggestions toward explanation, whether of
Sanford, or of Jastrow and Moorehouse, are once for all disproved
by the observation that if the moving rod is fairly broad
(say three quarters of an inch) and moves <i>slowly</i>, the bands are
seen nowhere so well as <i>on the rod itself</i>. One sees the rod
vaguely through the bands, as could scarcely happen if the
bands were images of the rod, or contrast-effects of the rod
against the sectors.</p>

<p>The case when the rod is broad and moves slowly is to be
accounted a special case. The following observations, up to
No. 8, were made with a narrow rod about five degrees in
width (narrower will do), moved by a metronome at less than
sixty beats per minute.</p>

<h3>III. OUTLINE OF THE FACTS OBSERVED.</h3>

<p>A careful study of the illusion yields the following points:</p>

<p>1. If the two sectors of the disc are unequal in arc, the
bands are unequal in width, and the narrower bands correspond
in color to the larger sector. Equal sectors give equally broad
bands.<span class="pagenum">[174]</span><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a></p>

<p>2. The faster the rod moves, the broader become the bands,
but not in like proportions; broad bands widen relatively more
than narrow ones; equal bands widen equally. As the bands
widen out it necessarily follows that the alternate bands come
to be farther apart.</p>

<p>3. The width of the bands increases if the speed of the revolving
disc decreases, but varies directly, as was before noted,
with the speed of the pendulating rod.</p>

<p>4. Adjacent bands are not sharply separated from each
other, the transition from one color to the other being gradual.
The sharpest definition is obtained when the rod is very narrow.
It is appropriate to name the regions where one band shades
over into the next 'transition-bands.' These transition-bands,
then, partake of the colors of both the sectors on the disc. It
is extremely difficult to distinguish in observation between
vagueness of the illusion due to feebleness in the after-image
depending on faint illumination, dark-colored discs or lack of
the desirable difference in luminosity between the sectors (cf.
<a href="#Page_171">p. 171</a>) and the indefiniteness which is due to broad transition-bands
existing between the (relatively) pure-color bands. Thus
much, however, seems certain (Jastrow and Moorehouse have
reported the same, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 203): the wider the rod, the
wider the transition-bands. It is to be noticed, moreover, that,
for rather swift movements of the rod, the bands are more
sharply defined if this movement is contrary to that of the disc
than if it is in like direction with that of the disc. That is, the
transition-bands are broader when rod and disc move in the
same, than when in opposite directions.</p>

<p>5. The total number of bands seen (the two colors being
alternately arranged and with transition-bands between) at any
one time is approximately constant, howsoever the widths of
the sectors and the width and rate of the rod may vary. But
the number of bands is inversely proportional, as Jastrow and
Moorehouse have shown (see above, <a href="#Page_169">p. 169</a>), to the time of rotation
of the disc; that is, the faster the disc, the more bands.
Wherefore, if the bands are broad (No. 2), they extend over a
large part of the disc; but if narrow, they cover only a small
strip lying immediately behind the rod.<span class="pagenum">[175]</span><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a></p>

<p>6. The colors of the bands approximate those of the two
sectors; the transition-bands present the adjacent 'pure colors'
merging into each other. But <i>all</i> the bands are modified in
favor of the color of the moving rod. If, now, the rod is itself
the same in color as one of the sectors, the bands which should
have been of the <i>other</i> color are not to be distinguished from
the fused color of the disc when no rod moves before it.</p>

<p>7. The bands are more strikingly visible when the two sectors
differ considerably in luminosity. But Jastrow's observation,
that a difference in luminosity is <i>necessary</i>, could not be
confirmed. Rather, on the contrary, sectors of the closest
obtainable luminosity still yielded the illusion, although faintly.</p>

<p>8. A <i>broad</i> but slowly moving rod shows the bands overlying
itself. Other bands can be seen left behind it on the disc.</p>

<p>9. But a case of a rod which is broad, or slowly-moving, or
both, is a special complication which involves several other and
<i>seemingly</i> quite contradictory phenomena to those already noted.
Since these suffice to show the principles by which the illusion is
to be explained, enumeration of the special variations is deferred.</p>

<h3>IV. THE GEOMETRICAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE ROD AND
THE SECTORS OF THE DISC.</h3>

<p>It should seem that any attempt to explain the illusion-bands
ought to begin with a consideration of the purely geometrical
relations holding between the slowly-moving rod and the
swiftly-revolving disc. First of all, then, it is evident that the
rod lies in front of each sector successively.</p>

<p>Let Fig. 1 represent the upper portion of a color-wheel,
with center at <i>O</i>, and with equal sectors <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, in front of
which a rod <i>P</i> oscillates to right and left on the same axis as
that of the wheel. Let the disc rotate clockwise, and let <i>P</i> be
observed in its rightward oscillation. Since the disc moves
faster than the rod, the front of the sector <i>A</i> will at some point
come up to and pass behind the rod <i>P</i>, say at <i>p<sup>A</sup>. P</i> now hides
a part of <i>A</i> and both are moving in the same direction. Since
the disc still moves the faster, the front of <i>A</i> will presently
emerge from behind <i>P</i>, then more and more of <i>A</i> will emerge,
until finally no part of it is hidden by <i>P</i>. If, now, <i>P</i> were
<span class="pagenum">[176]</span><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>merely a line (having no width) and were not moving, the last
of <i>A</i> would emerge just where its front edge had gone behind
<i>P</i>, namely at <i>p<sup>A</sup></i>. But <i>P</i> has a certain width and a certain rate
of motion, so that <i>A</i> will wholly emerge from behind <i>P</i> at some
point to the right, say <i>p<sup>B</sup></i>. How far to the right this will be
depends on the speed and width of <i>A</i>, and on the speed and
width of <i>P</i>.</p>

<p>Now, similarly, at <i>p<sup>B</sup></i> the sector <i>B</i> has come around and
begins to pass behind <i>P</i>. It in turn will emerge at some point
to the right, say <i>p<sup>C</sup></i>. And so the process will continue. From
<i>p<sup>A</sup></i> to <i>p<sup>B</sup></i> the pendulum covers some part of the sector <i>A</i>; from
<i>p<sup>B</sup></i> to <i>p<sup>C</sup></i> some part of sector <i>B</i>; from <i>p<sup>C</sup></i> to <i>P<sup>D</sup></i> some part of <i>A</i>
again, and so on.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="./images/187-fig1.png" width="601" height="410" alt="Fig. 1." title="" />
<p class="sccaption">Fig. 1.</p></div>

<p>If, now, the eye which watches this process is kept from
moving, these relations will be reproduced on the retina. For
the retinal area corresponding to the triangle <i>p<sup>A</sup>Op<sup>B</sup></i>, there will
be less stimulation from the sector <i>A</i> than there would have
been if the pendulum had not partly hidden it. That is,
the triangle in question will not be seen of the fused color of <i>A</i>
and <i>B</i>, but will lose a part of its <i>A</i>-component. In the same
way the triangle <i>p<sup>B</sup>OpC</i> will lose a part of its <i>B</i>-component;
and so on alternately. And by as much as either component is
lost, by so much will the color of the intercepting pendulum (in
this case, black) be present to make up the deficiency.</p>

<p>We see, then, that the purely geometrical relations of disc
<span class="pagenum">[177]</span><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>and pendulum necessarily involve for vision a certain banded
appearance of the area which is swept by the pendulum, if the
eye is held at rest. We have now to ask, Are these the bands
which we set out to study? Clearly enough these geometrically
inevitable bands can be exactly calculated, and their necessary
changes formulated for any given change in the speed or width
of <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, or <i>P</i>. If it can be shown that they must always vary
just as the bands we set out to study are <i>observed</i> to vary, it
will be certain that the bands of the illusion have no other cause
than the interception of retinal stimulation by the sectors of the
disc, due to the purely geometrical relations between the sectors
and the pendulum which hides them.</p>

<p>And exactly this will be found to be the case. The widths
of the bands of the illusion depend on the speed and widths of
the sectors and of the pendulum used; the colors and intensities
of the bands depend on the colors and intensities of the sectors
(and of the pendulum); while the total number of bands seen at
one time depends on all these factors.</p>

<h3>V. GEOMETRICAL DEDUCTION OF THE BANDS.</h3>

<p>In the first place, it is to be noted that if the pendulum proceeds
from left to right, for instance, before the disc, that portion
of the latter which lies in front of the advancing rod will
as yet not have been hidden by it, and will therefore be seen of
the unmodified, fused color. Only behind the pendulum, where
rotating sectors have been hidden, can the bands appear. And
this accords with the first observation (<a href="#Page_167">p. 167</a>), that &quot;The rod
appears to leave behind it on the disc a number of parallel
bands.&quot; It is as if the rod, as it passes, painted them on the
disc.</p>

<p>Clearly the bands are not formed simultaneously, but one
after another as the pendulum passes through successive positions.
And of course the newest bands are those which lie
immediately behind the pendulum. It must now be asked,
Why, if these bands are produced successively, are they seen
simultaneously? To this, Jastrow and Moorehouse have given
the answer, &quot;We are dealing with the phenomena of after-images.&quot;
The bands persist as after-images while new ones
<span class="pagenum">[178]</span><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>are being generated. The very oldest, however, disappear
<i>pari-passu</i> with the generation of the new. We have already
seen (<a href="#Page_169">p. 169</a>) how well these authors have shown this, in proving
that the number of bands seen, multiplied by the rate of
rotation of the disc, is a constant bearing some relation to the
duration of a retinal image of similar brightness to the bands.
It is to be noted now, however, that as soon as the rod has
produced a band and passed on, the after-image of that band
on the retina is exposed to the same stimulation from the rotating
disc as before, that is, is exposed to the fused color; and
this would tend to obliterate the after-images. Thus the oldest
bands would have to disappear more quickly than an unmolested
after-image of the same original brightness. We ought, then,
to see somewhat fewer bands than the formula of Jastrow and
Moorehouse would indicate. In other words, we should find
on applying the formula that the 'duration of the after-image'
must be decreased by a small amount before the numerical relations
would hold. Since Jastrow and Moorehouse did not
determine the relation of the after-image by an independent
measurement, their work neither confirms nor refutes this conjecture.</p>

<p>What they failed to emphasize is that the real origin of the
bands is not the intermittent appearances of the rod opposite the
<i>lighter</i> sector, as they seem to believe, but the successive eclipse
by the rod of <i>each</i> sector in turn.</p>

<p>If, in Fig. 2, we have a disc (composed of a green and a
red sector) and a pendulum, moving to the right, and if <i>P</i> represents
the pendulum at the instant when the green sector <i>AOB</i>
is beginning to pass behind it, it follows that some other position
farther to the right, as <i>P'</i>, will represent the pendulum just as
the last part of the sector is passing out from behind it. Some
part at least of the sector has been hidden during the entire
interval in which the pendulum was passing from <i>P</i> to <i>P'</i>.
Clearly the arc <i>BA'</i> measures the band <i>BOA'</i>, in which the
green stimulation from the sector <i>AOB</i> is thus at least partially
suppressed, that is, on which a relatively red band is being
produced. If the illusion really depends on the successive
eclipse of the sectors by the pendulum, as has been described,
<span class="pagenum">[179]</span><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>it will be possible to express BA', that is, the width of a band,
in terms of the widths and rates of movement of the two sectors
and of the pendulum. This expression will be an equation,
and from this it will be possible to derive the phenomena which
the bands of the illusion actually present as the speeds of disc
and rod, and the widths of sectors and rod, are varied.</p>

<p>It is to be remembered that <i>s</i> is the width of the sector which
undergoes eclipse, and that it is the color of that same sector
which is subtracted from the band <i>Z</i> in question. Therefore,
whether <i>Z</i> represents a green or a red band, <i>s</i> of the formula
must refer to the <i>oppositely colored</i> sector, <i>i.e.</i>, the one which
is at that time being hidden.</p>

<p>We have now to take cognizance of an item thus far neglected.
When the green sector has reached the position <i>A'B'</i>,
that is, is just emerging wholly from behind the pendulum, the
front of the red sector must already be in eclipse. The generation
of a green band (red sector in eclipse) will have commenced
somewhat before the generation of the red band (green sector
in eclipse) has ended. For a moment the pendulum will lie
over parts of both sectors, and while the red band ends at point
<i>A'</i>, the green band will have already commenced at a point
somewhat to the left (and, indeed, to the left by a trifle more
than the width of the pendulum). In other words, the two
bands <i>overlap</i>.</p>

<p>This area of overlapping may itself be accounted a band,
since here the pendulum hides partly red and partly green, and
obviously the result for sensation will not be the same as for
those areas where red or green alone is hidden. We may call
<span class="pagenum">[181]</span><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>the overlapped area a 'transition-band,' and we must then ask
if it corresponds to the 'transition-bands' spoken of in the
observations.</p>

<p>Now the formula obtained for Z includes two such transition-bands,
one generated in the vicinity of OB and one near OA'.
To find the formula for a band produced while the pendulum
conceals solely one, the oppositely colored sector (we may call
this a 'pure-color' band and let its width = W), we must find
the formula for the width (w) of a transition-band, multiply it
by two, and subtract the product from the value for Z already
found.</p>

<p>The formula for an overlapping or transition-band can be
readily found by considering it to be a band formed by the passage
behind P of a sector whose width is zero. Thus if, in the
expression for Z already found, we substitute zero for s, we
shall get w; that is,</p>

<p>Before asking if this pure-color band <i>W</i> can be identified
with the bands observed in the illusion, we have to remember
that the value which we have found for <i>W</i> is true only if disc
and pendulum are moving in the same direction; whereas the
illusion-bands are observed indifferently as disc and pendulum
move in the same or in opposite directions. Nor is any difference
in their width easily observable in the two cases, although
it is to be borne in mind that there may be a difference too small
to be noticed unless some measuring device is used.</p>

<p>From Fig. 4 we can find the width of a pure-color band (<i>W</i>)
when pendulum and disc move in opposite directions. The letters
are used as in the preceding case, and <i>W</i> will include no
transition-band.<span class="pagenum">[183]</span><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a></p>

<h3>VI. APPLICATION OF THE FORMULAS TO THE BANDS OF THE
ILLUSION.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum">[185]</span><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>Will these formulas, now, explain the phenomena which
the bands of the illusion actually present in respect to their
width?</p>

<p>1. The first phenomenon noticed (<a href="#Page_173">p. 173</a>, No. 1) is that &quot;If
the two sectors of the disc are unequal in arc, the bands are unequal
in width; and the narrower bands correspond in color to
the larger sector. Equal sectors give equally broad bands.&quot;</p>

<p>In formula 3, <i>W</i> represents the width of a band, and <i>s</i> the
width of the <i>oppositely colored</i> sector. Therefore, if a disc is
composed, for example, of a red and a green sector, then</p>

<div class="center"><table summary="">
<colgroup align="center" span="3"></colgroup>
<tr><td rowspan="2" valign="middle">W(red) =</td><td><span class="underline">rs(green) -  pr'</span> , </td></tr>
<tr><td>r' &plusmn; r</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>and</p>

<div class="center"><table summary="">
<colgroup align="center" span="3"></colgroup>
<tr><td rowspan="2" valign="middle">W(green) =</td>
<td><span class="underline">rs(red) -  pr'</span> ,</td></tr>
<tr><td>r' &plusmn; r</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>therefore, by dividing,</p>

<div class="center"><table summary="">
<colgroup align="center" span="3"></colgroup>
<tr><td><span class="underline">&nbsp;W(red)&nbsp;</span></td>
<td rowspan="2" valign="middle">=</td>
<td><span class="underline">rs(green) -  pr'</span> .</td></tr>
<tr><td>W(green)</td><td>rs(red) -  pr'</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>From this last equation it is clear that unless <i>s</i>(green) = <i>s</i>(red),
<i>W</i>(red) cannot equal <i>W</i>(green). That is, if the two sectors
are unequal in width, the bands are also unequal. This was
the first feature of the illusion above noted.</p>

<p>Again, if one sector is larger, the oppositely colored bands
will be larger, that is, the light-colored bands will be narrower;
or, in other words, 'the narrower bands correspond in color to
the larger sector.'</p>

<p>Finally, if the sectors are equal, the bands must also be
equal.</p>

<p>So far, then, the bands geometrically deduced present the
same variations as the bands observed in the illusion.</p>

<p>2. Secondly (<a href="#Page_174">p. 174</a>, No. 2), &quot;The faster the rod moves the
broader become the bands, but not in like proportions; broad
bands widen relatively more than narrow ones.&quot; The speed of
the rod or pendulum, in degrees per second, equals <i>r</i>. Now
if <i>W</i> increases when <i>r</i> increases, <i>D<sub>&tau;</sub>W</i> must be positive or<span class="pagenum">[186]</span><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>
greater than zero for all values of <i>r</i> which lie in question.</p>

<p>Now</p>

<div class="center"><table summary="">
<colgroup align="center" span="3"></colgroup>
<tr><td rowspan="2" valign="middle">W =</td>
<td><span class="underline">rs - pr'</span> ,</td></tr>
<tr><td>r' &plusmn; r</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>and</p>

<div class="center"><table summary="">
<colgroup align="center" span="3"></colgroup>
<tr><td rowspan="2" valign="middle"><i>D<sub>&tau;</sub>W</i> =</td>
<td><span class="underline">(r' &plusmn; r)s <span class="overline">+</span> (rs - pr')</span> ,</td></tr>
<tr><td>(r &plusmn; r')&sup2;</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>or reduced,</p>

<div class="center"><table summary="">
<colgroup align="center" span="3"></colgroup>
<tr><td rowspan="2" valign="middle">=</td><td><span class="underline">r'(s &plusmn; p)</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>(r' &plusmn; r)&sup2;</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>Since <i>r'</i> (the speed of the disc) is always positive, and <i>s</i> is
always greater than <i>p</i> (cf. <a href="#Page_173">p. 173</a>), and since the denominator
is a square and therefore positive, it follows that</p>

<p class="center"><i>D<sub>&tau;</sub>W</i> &gt; 0</p>

<p>or that <i>W</i> increases if <i>r</i> increases.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if <i>W</i> is a wide band, <i>s</i> is the wider sector.
The rate of increase of <i>W</i> as <i>r</i> increases is</p>

<div class="center"><table summary="">
<colgroup align="center" span="3"></colgroup>
<tr><td rowspan="2" valign="middle"><i>D<sub>&tau;</sub>W</i> =</td>
<td><span class="underline">r'(s &plusmn; p)</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>(r' &plusmn; r)&sup2;</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>which is larger if <i>s</i> is larger (<i>s</i> and <i>r</i> being always positive).
That is, as <i>r</i> increases, 'broad bands widen relatively more than
narrow ones.'</p>

<p>3. Thirdly (<a href="#Page_174">p. 174</a>, No. 3), &quot;The width of The bands increases
if the speed of the revolving disc decreases.&quot; This speed
is <i>r'</i>. That the observed fact is equally true of the geometrical
bands is clear from inspection, since in</p>

<div class="center"><table summary="">
<colgroup align="center" span="3"></colgroup>
<tr><td rowspan="2" valign="middle">W =</td>
<td><span class="underline">rs - pr'</span> ,</td></tr>
<tr><td>r' &plusmn; r</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>as <i>r'</i> decreases, the denominator of the right-hand member decreases
while the numerator increases.</p>

<p>4. We now come to the transition-bands, where one color
shades over into the other. It was observed (<a href="#Page_174">p. 174</a>, No. 4) that,
&quot;These partake of the colors of both the sectors on the disc.
The wider the rod the wider the transition-bands.&quot;<span class="pagenum">[187]</span><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a></p>

<p>We have already seen (<a href="#Page_180">p. 180</a>) that at intervals the pendulum
conceals a portion of both the sectors, so that at those points
the color of the band will be found not by deducting either color
alone from the fused color, but by deducting a small amount of
both colors in definite proportions. The locus of the positions
where both colors are to be thus deducted we have provisionally
called (in the geometrical section) 'transition-bands.' Just as
for pure-color bands, this locus is a radial sector, and we have
found its width to be (formula 6, <a href="#Page_184">p. 184</a>)</p>

<div class="center"><table summary="">
<colgroup align="center" span="3"></colgroup>
<tr><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td rowspan="2" valign="middle">W =</td><td>pr'</td><td> ,</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="overline">r' &plusmn; r</span></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Now, are these bands of bi-color deduction identical with the
transition-bands observed in the illusion? Since the total concealing
capacity of the pendulum for any given speed is fixed,
less of <i>either</i> color can be deducted for a transition-band than is
deducted of one color for a pure-color band. Therefore, a
transition-band will never be so different from the original
fusion-color as will either 'pure-color' band; that is, compared
with the pure color-bands, the transition-bands will 'partake of
the colors of both the sectors on the disc.' Since</p>

<div class="center"><table summary="">
<colgroup align="center" span="3"></colgroup>
<tr><td rowspan="2" valign="middle">W =</td><td>pr'</td><td> ,</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="overline">r' &plusmn; r</span></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>it is clear that an increase of <i>p</i> will give an increase of <i>w</i>; <i>i.e.</i>,
'the wider the rod, the wider the transition-bands.'</p>

<p>Since <i>r</i> is the rate of the rod and is always less than <i>r'</i>, the
more rapidly the rod moves, the wider will be the transition-bands
when rod and disc move in the same direction, that is, when</p>

<div class="center"><table summary="">
<colgroup align="center" span="3"></colgroup>
<tr><td rowspan="2" valign="middle">W =</td><td>pr'</td><td> ,</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="overline">r' - r</span></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>But the contrary will be true when they move in opposite directions,
for then</p>

<div class="center"><table summary="">
<colgroup align="center" span="3"></colgroup>
<tr><td rowspan="2" valign="middle">W =</td><td>pr'</td><td> ,</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="overline">r' + r</span></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>that is, the larger <i>r</i> is, the narrower is <i>w</i>.<span class="pagenum">[188]</span><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a></p>

<p>The present writer could not be sure whether or not the
width of transition-bands varied with <i>r</i>. He did observe, however
(<a href="#Page_174">page 174</a>) that 'the transition-bands are broader when rod
and disc move in the same, than when in opposite directions.'
This will be true likewise for the geometrical bands, for, whatever
<i>r</i> (up to and including <i>r = r'</i>),</p>

<div class="center"><table summary="">
<colgroup align="center" span="3"></colgroup>
<tr><td>pr'</td><td rowspan="2" valign="middle">&gt;</td><td>pr'</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="overline">r'- r</span></td><td><span class="overline">r' + r</span></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>In the observation, of course, <i>r</i>, the rate of the rod, was never
so large as <i>r'</i>, the rate of the disc.</p>

<p>5. We next come to an observation (<a href="#Page_174">p. 174</a>, No. 5) concerning
the number of bands seen at any one time. The 'geometrical
deduction of the bands,' it is remembered, was concerned
solely with the amount of color which was to be deducted from
the fused color of the disc. <i>W</i> and <i>w</i> represented the widths
of the areas whereon such deduction was to be made. In observation
5 we come on new considerations, <i>i.e.</i>, as to the color
from which the deduction is to be made, and the fate of the
momentarily hidden area which suffers deduction, <i>after</i> the
pendulum has passed on.</p>

<p>We shall best consider these matters in terms of a concept
of which Marbe<a name="FNanchor_3_71" id="FNanchor_3_71"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_3_71'>3</a> has made admirable use: the 'characteristic
effect.' The Talbot-Plateau law states that when two or more
periodically alternating stimulations are given to the retina,
there is a certain minimal rate of alternation required to produce
a just constant sensation. This minimal speed of succession is
called the critical period. Now, Marbe calls the effect on the
retina of a light-stimulation which lasts for the unit of time, the
'photo-chemical unit-effect.' And he says (<i>op. cit.</i>, S. 387):
&quot;If we call the unit of time 1&sigma;, the sensation for each point on
the retina in each unit of time is a function of the simultaneous
and the few immediately preceding unit-effects; this is the characteristic
effect.&quot;</p>

<p>We may now think of the illusion-bands as being so and so
many different 'characteristic effects' given simultaneously in
<span class="pagenum">[189]</span><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>so and so many contiguous positions on the retina. But so also
may we think of the geometrical interception-bands, and for
these we can deduce a number of further properties. So far
the observed illusion-bands and the interception-bands have
been found identical, that is, in so far as their widths under
various conditions are concerned. We have now to see if they
present further points of identity.</p>

<p>As to the characteristic effects incident to the interception-bands;
in Fig. 7 (Plate V.), let <i>A'C'</i> represent at a given moment
<i>M</i>, the total circumference of a color-disc, <i>A'B'</i> represent
a green sector of 90&deg;, and <i>B'C'</i> a red complementary
sector of 270&deg;. If the disc is supposed to rotate from left to
right, it is clear that a moment previous to <i>M</i> the two sectors
and their intersection <i>B</i> will have occupied a position slightly
to the left. If distance perpendicularly above <i>A'C'</i> is conceived
to represent time previous to <i>M</i>, the corresponding previous
positions of the sectors will be represented by the oblique bands
of the figure. The narrow bands (<i>GG</i>, <i>GG</i>) are the loci of
the successive positions of the green sector; the broader bands
(<i>RR</i>, <i>RR</i>), of the red sector.</p>

<p>In the figure, 0.25 mm. vertically = the unit of time = 1&sigma;.
The successive stimulations given to the retina by the disc <i>A'C'</i>,
say at a point <i>A'</i>, during the interval preceding the moment <i>M</i>
will be</p>

<div class="center"><table width="25%" summary="">
<colgroup span="2" align="left"></colgroup>
<tr><td>green</td><td>10&sigma;,</td></tr>
<tr><td>red</td><td>30&sigma;,</td></tr>
<tr><td>green</td><td>10&sigma;,</td></tr>
<tr><td>red</td><td>30&sigma;, etc.</td></tr></table>
</div>

<p>Now a certain number of these stimulations which immediately
precede <i>M</i> will determine the characteristic effect, the fusion
color, for the point <i>A'</i> at the moment <i>M</i>. We do not know the
number of unit-stimulations which contribute to this characteristic
effect, nor do we need to, but it will be a constant, and can be
represented by a distance <i>x</i> = <i>A'A</i> above the line <i>A'C'</i>. Then
<i>A'A</i> will represent the total stimulus which determines the characteristic
effect at <i>A'</i>. Stimuli earlier than <i>A</i> are no longer
represented in the after-image. <i>AC</i> is parallel to <i>A'C'</i>, and
<span class="pagenum">[190]</span><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>the characteristic effect for any point is found by drawing the
perpendicular at that point between the two lines <i>A'C</i> and <i>AC</i>.</p>

<p>Just as the movement of the disc, so can that of the concealing
pendulum be represented. The only difference is that the
pendulum is narrower, and moves more slowly. The slower
rate is represented by a steeper locus-band, <i>PP'</i>, than those of
the swifter sectors.</p>

<p>We are now able to consider geometrically deduced bands
as 'characteristic effects,' and we have a graphic representation
of the color-deduction determined by the interception of the
pendulum. The deduction-value of the pendulum is the distance
(<i>xy</i>) which it intercepts on a line drawn perpendicular to
<i>A'C'</i>.</p>

<p>Lines drawn perpendicular to <i>A'C'</i> through the points of intersection
of the locus-band of the pendulum with those of the
sectors will give a 'plot' on <i>A'C'</i> of the deduction-bands.
Thus from 1 to 2 the deduction is red and the band green; from
2 to 3 the deduction is decreasingly red and increasingly green,
a transition-band; from 3 to 4 the deduction is green and the
band red; and so forth.</p>

<p>We are now prepared to continue our identification of these
geometrical interception-bands with the bands observed in the
illusion. It is to be noted in passing that this graphic representation
of the interception-bands as characteristic effects (Fig. 7)
is in every way consistent with the previous equational treatment
of the same bands. A little consideration of the figure
will show that variations of the widths and rates of sectors and
pendulum will modify the widths of the bands exactly as has
been shown in the equations.</p>

<p>The observation next at hand (<a href="#Page_174">p. 174</a>, No. 5) is that &quot;The
total number of bands seen at any one time is approximately
constant, howsoever the widths of the sectors and the width and
rate of the rod may vary. But the number of bands is inversely
proportional (Jastrow and Moorehouse) to the time of rotation
of the disc; that is, the faster the disc, the more bands.&quot;</p>

<div class="center"><a name="PLATE5"></a><span class="sc">Psychological Review. Monograph Supplement, 17. Plate V.</span>

<p class="sccaption">Fig. 9.</p></div>


<p><span class="pagenum">[191]</span><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>This is true, point for point, of the interception-bands of Fig.
7. It is clear that the number of bands depends on the number of
intersections of <i>PP'</i> with the several locus-bands <i>RR</i>, <i>GG</i>, <i>RR</i>,
etc. Since the two sectors are complementary, having a constant
sum of 360&deg;, their relative widths will not affect the number
of such intersections. Nor yet will the width of the rod <i>P</i>
affect it. As to the speed of <i>P</i>, if the locus-bands are parallel
to the line <i>A'C'</i>, that is, of the disc moved <i>infinitely</i> rapidly,
there would be the same number of intersections, no matter
what the rate of <i>P</i>, that is, whatever the obliqueness of <i>PP'</i>.
But although the disc does not rotate with infinite speed, it is
still true that for a considerable range of values for the speed
of the pendulum the number of intersections is constant. The
observations of Jastrow and Moorehouse were probably made
within such a range of values of <i>r</i>. For while their disc varied
in speed from 12 to 33 revolutions per second, that is, 4,320 to
11,880 degrees per second, the rod was merely passed to and fro
by hand through an excursion of six inches (J. and M., <i>op. cit.</i>,
pp. 203-5), a method which could have given no speed of the
rod comparable to that of the disc. Indeed, their fastest speed
for the rod, to calculate from certain of their data, was less
than 19 inches per second.</p>

<p>The present writer used about the same rates, except that
for the disc no rate below 24 revolutions per second was employed.
This is about the rate which v. Helmholtz<a name="FNanchor_4_72" id="FNanchor_4_72"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_4_72'>4</a> gives as
the slowest which will yield fusion from a bi-sectored disc in
good illumination. It is hard to imagine how, amid the confusing
flicker of a disc revolving but 12 times in the second,
Jastrow succeeded in taking any reliable observations at all of
the bands. Now if, in Fig. 8 (Plate V.), 0.25 mm. on the base-line
equals one degree, and in the vertical direction equals
1&sigma;, the locus-bands of the sectors (here equal to each other in
width), make such an angle with <i>A'C'</i> as represents the disc to
be rotating exactly 36 times in a second. It will be seen that
the speed of the rod may vary from that shown by the locus
<i>P'P</i> to that shown by <i>P'A</i>; and the speeds represented are
respectively 68.96 and 1,482.64 degrees per second; and
throughout this range of speeds the locus-band of <i>P</i> intercepts
the loci of the sectors always the same number of times. Thus,
<span class="pagenum">[192]</span><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>if the disc revolves 36 times a second, the pendulum may move
anywhere from 69 to 1,483 degrees per second without changing
the number of bands seen at a time.</p>

<p>And from the figure it will be seen that this is true whether
the pendulum moves in the same direction as the disc, or in the
opposite direction. This range of speed is far greater than
the concentrically swinging metronome of the present writer
would give. The rate of Jastrow's rod, of 19 inches per second,
cannot of course be exactly translated into degrees, but
it probably did not exceed the limit of 1,483. Therefore,
although beyond certain wide limits the rate of the pendulum
will change the total number of deduction-bands seen, yet the
observations were, in all probability (and those of the present
writer, surely), taken within the aforesaid limits. So that
as the observations have it, &quot;The total number of bands seen
at any one time is approximately constant, howsoever ... the
rate of the rod may vary.&quot; On this score, also, the illusion-bands
and the deduction-bands present no differences.</p>

<p>But outside of this range it can indeed be <i>observed</i> that the
number of bands does vary with the rate of the rod. If this
rate (<i>r</i>) is increased beyond the limits of the previous observations,
it will approach the rate of the disc (<i>r'</i>). Let us increase
<i>r</i> until <i>r</i> = <i>r'</i>. To observe the resulting bands, we have but to
attach the rod or pendulum to the front of the disc and let both
rotate together. No bands are seen, <i>i.e.</i>, the number of bands
has become zero. And this, of course, is just what should
have been expected from a consideration of the deduction-bands
in Fig. 8.</p>

<p>One other point in regard to the total number of bands seen:
it was observed (<a href="#Page_174">page 174</a>, No. 5) that, &quot;The faster the disc, the
more bands.&quot; This too would hold of the deduction-bands, for
the faster the disc and sectors move, the narrower and more
nearly parallel to <i>A'C'</i> (Fig. 7) will be their locus-bands, and
the more of these bands will be contained within the vertical
distance <i>A'A</i> (or <i>C'C</i>), which, it is remembered, represents
the age of the oldest after-image which still contributes to the
characteristic effect. <i>PP'</i> will therefore intercept more loci of
sectors, and more deduction-bands will be generated.<span class="pagenum">[193]</span><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a></p>

<p>6. &quot;The colors of the bands (<a href="#Page_175">page 175</a>, No. 6) approximate
those of the two sectors; the transition-bands present the
adjacent 'pure colors' merging into each other. But <i>all</i> the
bands are modified in favor of the moving rod. If, now, the
rod is itself the same in color as one of the sectors, the bands
which should have been of the other color are not to be distinguished
from the fused color of the disc when no rod moves
before it.&quot;</p>

<p>These items are equally true of the deduction-bands, since a
deduction of a part of one of the components from a fused color
must leave an approximation to the other component. And
clearly, too, by as much as either color is deducted, by so much
must the color of the pendulum itself be added. So that, if the
pendulum is like one of the sectors in color, whenever that sector
is hidden the deduction for concealment will exactly equal the
added allowance for the color of the pendulum, and there will
be no bands of the other color distinguishable from the fused
color of the disc.</p>

<p>It is clear from Fig. 7 why a transition-band shades gradually
from one pure-color band over into the other. Let us consider
the transition-band 2-3 (Fig. 7). Next it on the right is a
green band, on the left a red. Now at the right-hand edge of
the transition-band it is seen that the deduction is mostly red and
very little green, a ratio which changes toward the left to one
of mostly green and very little red. Thus, next to the red band
the transition-band will be mostly red, and it will shade continuously
over into green on the side adjacent to the green band.</p>

<p>7. The next observation given (<a href="#Page_175">page 175</a>, No. 7) was that,
&quot;The bands are more strikingly visible when the two sectors
differ considerably in luminosity.&quot; This is to be expected,
since the greater the contrast, whether in regard to color, saturation,
or intensity, between the sectors, the greater will be such
contrast between the two deductions, and hence the greater will
it be between the resulting bands. And, therefore, the bands
will be more strikingly distinguishable from each other, that is,
'visible.'</p>

<p>8. &quot;A <i>broad</i> but slowly-moving rod shows the bands lying
over itself. Other bands can also be seen behind it on the disc.&quot;<span class="pagenum">[194]</span><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a></p>

<p>In Fig. 9 (Plate V.) are shown the characteristic effects produced
by a broad and slowly-moving rod. Suppose it to be black.
It can be so broad and move so slowly that for a space the characteristic
effect is largely black (Fig. 9 on both sides of <i>x</i>).
Specially will this be true between <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, for here, while the
pendulum contributes no <i>more</i> photo-chemical unit-effects, it
will contribute the newer one, and howsoever many unit-effects
go to make up the characteristic effect, the newer units are
undoubtedly the more potent elements in determining this effect.
The old units have partly faded. One may say that the newest
units are 'weighted.'</p>

<p>Black will predominate, then, on both sides of <i>x</i>, but specially
between <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>. For a space, then, the characteristic effect
will contain enough black to yield a 'perception of the rod.'
The width of this region depends on the width and speed of the
rod, but in Fig. 9 it will be roughly coincident with <i>xy</i>, though
somewhat behind (to the left of) it. The characteristic will be
either wholly black, as just at <i>x</i>, or else largely black with the
yet contributory after-images (shown in the triangle <i>aby</i>). Some
bands will thus be seen overlying the rod (1-8), and others
lying back of it (9-16).</p>

<p>We have now reviewed all the phenomena so far enumerated
of the illusion-bands, and for every case we have identified these
bands with the bands which must be generated on the retina by
the mere concealment of the rotating sectors by the moving rod.
It has been more feasible thus far to treat these deduction-bands
as if possibly they were other than the bands of the illusion; for
although the former must certainly appear on the retina, yet it
was not clear that the illusion-bands did not involve additional
and complicated retinal or central processes. The showing that
the two sets of bands have in every case identical properties,
shows that they are themselves identical. The illusion-bands
are thus explained to be due merely to the successive concealment
of the sectors of the disc as each passes in turn behind
the moving pendulum. The only physiological phenomena
involved in this explanation have been the persistence as after-images
of retinal stimulations, and the summation of these
persisting images into characteristic effects&mdash;both familiar phenomena.<span class="pagenum">[195]</span><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a></p>

<p>From this point on it is permissible to simplify the point of
view by accounting the deduction-bands and the bands of the
illusion fully identified, and by referring to them under either
name indifferently. Figs. 1 to 9, then, are diagrams of the
bands which we actually observe on the rotating disc. We
have next briefly to consider a few special complications produced
by a greater breadth or slower movement of the rod, or
by both together. These conditions are called 'complicating'
not arbitrarily, but because in fact they yield the bands in confusing
form. If the rod is broad, the bands appear to overlap;
and if the rod moves back and forth, at first rapidly but with
decreasing speed, periods of mere confusion occur which defy
description; but the bands of the minor color may be broader or
<i>may be narrower</i> than those of the other color.</p>

<h3>VII. FURTHER COMPLICATIONS OF THE ILLUSION.</h3>

<p>9. If the rod is broad and moves slowly, the narrower bands
are like colored, not with the broader, as before, but with the
narrower sector.</p>

<p>The conditions are shown in Fig. 9. From 1 to 2 the
deduction is increasingly green, and yet the remainder of the
characteristic effect is also mostly green at 1, decreasingly so to
the right, and at 2 is preponderantly red; and so on to 8; while
a like consideration necessitates bands from <i>x</i> to 16. All the
bands are in a sense transition-bands, but 1-2 will be mostly
green, 2-3 mostly red, and so forth. Clearly the widths of the
bands will be here proportional to the widths of the like-colored
sectors, and not as before to the oppositely colored.</p>

<p>It may reasonably be objected that there should be here no
bands at all, since the same considerations would give an increasingly
red band from <i>B'</i> to <i>A'</i>, whereas by hypothesis the
disc rotates so fast as to give an entirely uniform color. It is
true that when the characteristic effect is <i>A' A</i> entire, the fusion-color
is so well established as to assimilate a fresh stimulus of
either of the component colors, without itself being modified.
But on the area from 1 to 16 the case is different, for here the
fusion-color is less well established, a part of the essential
colored units having been replaced by black, the color of the
<span class="pagenum">[196]</span><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>rod; and black is no stimulation. So that the same increment
of component color, before ineffective, is now able to modify
the enfeebled fusion-color.</p>

<p>Observation confirms this interpretation, in that band <i>y</i>-1 is
not red, but merely the fusion-color slightly darkened by an
increment of black. Furthermore, if the rod is broad and slow
in motion, but white instead of black, no bands can be seen
overlying the rod. For here the small successive increments
which would otherwise produce the bands 1-2, 2-3, etc., have
no effect on the remainder of the fusion-color plus the relatively
intense increment of white.</p>

<p>It may be said here that the bands 1-2, 2-3, etc., are less
intense than the bands <i>x</i>-9, 9-10, etc., because there the
recent or weighted unit-effects are black, while here they are
the respective colors. Also the bands grow dimmer from <i>x</i>-9
to 15-16, that is, as they become older, for the small increment
of one color which would give band 15-16 is almost wholly
overridden by the larger and fresher mass of stimulation which
makes for mere fusion. This last is true of the bands always,
whatever the rate or width of the rod.</p>

<p>10. In general, equal sectors give equal bands, but if one
sector is considerably more intense than the other, the bands of
the brighter color will, for a broad and swiftly-moving rod, be
the broader. The brighter sector, though equal in width to
the other, contributes more toward determining the fusion-color;
and this fact is represented by an intrusion of the stronger
color into the transition-bands, at the expense of the weaker.
For in these, even the decreased amount of the stronger color,
on the side next a strong-color band, is yet more potent than
the increased amount of the feebler color. In order to observe
this fact one must have the rod broad, so as to give a broad
transition-band on which the encroachment of the stronger color
may be evident. The process is the same with a narrow rod
and narrow transition-bands, but, being more limited in extent,
it is less easily observed. The rod must also move rapidly, for
otherwise the bands overlap and become obscure, as will be
seen in the next paragraph.</p>

<p>11. If the disc consists of a broad and narrow sector, and if
<span class="pagenum">[197]</span><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>the rod is broad and moves at first rapidly but more slowly with
each new stroke, there are seen at first broad, faint bands of
the minority-color, and narrow bands of the majority-color.
The former grow continuously more intense as the rod moves
more slowly, and grow narrower in width down to zero; whereupon
the other bands seem to overlap, the overlapped part being
doubly deep in color, while the non-overlapped part has come
to be more nearly the color of the minor sector. The overlapped
portion grows in width. As the rate of the rod now
further decreases, a confused state ensues which cannot be described.
When, finally, the rod is moving very slowly, the
phenomena described above in paragraph 9 occur.</p>

<p>The successive changes in appearance as the rod moves
more and more slowly, are due to the factors previously mentioned,
and to one other which follows necessarily from the given
conditions but has not yet been considered. This is the last new
principle in the illusion which we shall have to take up. Just
as the transition-bands are regions where two pure-color bands
overlap, so, when the rod is broad and moves slowly, other overlappings
occur to produce more complicated arrangements.</p>

<p>These can be more compactly shown by diagram than by
words. Fig. 10, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> (Plate VI.), show successively slower
speeds of the rod, while all the other factors are the same. In
practice the tendency is to perceive the transition-bands as parts of
the broad faint band of the minor color, which lies between them.
It can be seen, then, how the narrow major-color bands grow
only slightly wider (Fig. 10, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) until they overlap (<i>c</i>); how
the broad minor-color bands grow very narrow and more intense
in color, there being always more of the major color deducted
(in <i>b</i> they are reduced exactly to zero, <i>z</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>z</i>). In <i>c</i>
the major-color bands overlap (<i>o</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>o</i>) to give a narrow but
doubly intense major-color band since, although with one major,
two minor locus-bands are deducted. The other bands also
overlap to give complicated combinations between the <i>o</i>-bands.
These mixed bands will be, in part at least, minor-color bands
(<i>q</i>, <i>q</i>, <i>q</i>), since, although a minor locus-band is here deducted,
yet nearly two major locus-bands are also taken, leaving the
minor color to predominate. This corresponds with the observation
<span class="pagenum">[198]</span><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>above, that, ' ... the non-overlapped part has come
to be more nearly the color of the minor sector.'</p>

<p>A slightly slower speed of the rod would give an irreducible
confusion of bands, since the order in which they overlap
becomes very complicated. Finally, when the rod comes
to move very slowly, as in Fig. 9, the appearance suffers no
further change, except for a gradual narrowing of all the bands,
up to the moment when the rod comes to rest.</p>

<p>It is clear that this last principle adduced, of the multiple
overlapping of bands when the rod is broad and moves slowly,
can give for varying speeds of the rod the greatest variety of
combinations of the bands. Among these is to be included that
of no bands at all, as will be understood from Fig. 11 (Plate VII).
And in fact, a little practice will enable the observer so to adjust
the rate of the (broad) rod to that of the disc that no bands are
observable. But care must be taken here that the eye is rigidly
fixated and not attracted into movement by the rod, since of
course if the eye moves with the rod, no bands can be seen,
whatever the rate of movement may be.</p>

<p>Thus, all the phenomena of these illusion-bands have been
explained as the result solely of the hiding by the rod of successive
sectors of the disc. The only physiological principles
involved are those (1) of the duration of after-images, and (2)
of their summation into a characteristic effect. It may have
seemed to the reader tedious and unnecessary so minutely to
study the bands, especially the details last mentioned; yet it was
necessary to show how <i>all</i> the possible observable phenomena
arise from the purely geometrical fact that sectors are successively
hidden. Otherwise the assertions of previous students of
the illusion, that more intricate physiological processes are
involved, could not have been refuted. The present writer does
not assert that no processes like contrast, induction, etc., come
into play to modify somewhat the saturation, etc., of the colors
in the bands. It must be here as in every other case of vision.
But it is now demonstrated that these remoter physiological
processes contribute nothing <i>essential</i> to the illusion. For
these could be dispensed with and the illusion would still remain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[199]</span><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>If any reader still suspects that more is involved than the
persistence after-images, and their summation into a characteristic
effect, he will find it interesting to study the illusion with
a camera. The 'physiological' functions referred to belong as
well to the dry-plate as to the retina, while the former exhibits,
presumably, neither contrast nor induction. The illusion-bands
can be easily photographed in a strong light, if white and black
sectors are used in place of colored ones. It is best to arrange
the other variable factors so as to make the transition-bands as
narrow as possible (<a href="#Page_174">p. 174</a>, No. 4). The writer has two negatives
which show the bands very well, although so delicately
that it is not feasible to try to reproduce them.</p>

<h3>VIII. SOME CONVENIENT DEVICES FOR EXHIBITING THE
ILLUSION.</h3>

<p>The influence of the width of sector is prettily shown by a
special disc like that shown in Fig. 12 (Plate VII.), where the
colors are dark-red and light-green, the shaded being the darker
sector. A narrow rod passed before such a disc by hand at a
moderate rate will give over the outer ring equally wide green
and red bands; but on the inner rings the red bands grow narrower,
the green broader.</p>

<p>The fact that the bands are not 'images of the rod' can be
shown by another disc (Fig. 13, Plate VII.). In all three rings
the lighter (green) sector is 60&deg; wide, but disposed on the disc
as shown. The bands are broken into zigzags. The parts
over the outer ring lag behind those over the middle, and these
behind those over the inner ring&mdash;'behind,' that is, farther behind
the rod.</p>

<p>Another effective variation is to use rods alike in color with
one or the other of the sectors. Here it is clear that when the
rod hides the oppositely-colored sector, the deduction of that
color is replaced (not by black, as happens if the rod is black)
but by the very color which is already characteristic of that
band. But when the rod hides the sector of its own color, the
deduction is replaced by the very same color. Thus, bands
like colored with the rod gain in depth of tone, while the other
pure-color bands present simply the fusion-color.<span class="pagenum">[200]</span><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a></p>


<h3>IX. A STROBOSCOPE WHICH DEPENDS ON THE SAME PRINCIPLE.</h3>

<p>If one produce the illusion by using for rod, not the pendulum
of a metronome, but a black cardboard sector on a second
color-mixer placed in front of the first and rotating concentrically
with it, that is, with the color-disc, one will observe with
the higher speeds of the rod which are now obtainable several
further phenomena, all of which follow simply from the geometrical
relations of disc and rod (now a rotating sector), as discussed
above. The color-mixer in front, which bears the sector
(let it still be called a 'rod'), should rotate by hand and independently
of the disc behind, whose two sectors are to give the
bands. The sectors of the disc should now be equal, and the
rod needs to be broader than before, say 50&deg; or 60&deg;, since it is
to revolve very rapidly.</p>

<p>First, let the rod and disc rotate in the same direction, the
disc at its former rate, while the rod begins slowly and moves
faster and faster. At first there is a confused appearance of
vague, radial shadows shuffling to and fro. This is because
the rod is broad and moves slowly (cf. <a href="#Page_196">p. 196</a>, paragraph II).</p>

<p>As the velocity of the rod increases, a moment will come
when the confusing shadows will resolve themselves into four
(sometimes five) radial bands of one color with four of the other
color and the appropriate transition-bands between them. The
bands of either color are symmetrically disposed over the disc,
that is, they lie at right angles to one another (if there are five
bands they lie at angles of 72&deg;, etc.). But this entire system
of bands, instead of lying motionless over the disc as did the
systems hitherto described, itself rotates rapidly in the opposite
direction from disc to rod. As the rod rotates forward yet
faster, no change is seen except that the system of bands
moves backward more and more slowly. Thus, if one rotate
the rod with one's own hand, one has the feeling that the backward
movement of the bands is an inverse function of the increase
in velocity of the rod. And, indeed, as this velocity still
increases, the bands gradually come to rest, although both the
disc and the rod are rotating rapidly.</p>

<p>But the system of bands is at rest for only a particular rate
of the rod. As the latter rotates yet faster, the system of bands
now commences to rotate slowly forward (with the disc and
rod), then more and more rapidly (the velocity of the rod still
increasing), until it finally disintegrates and the bands vanish
into the confused flicker of shadows with which the phenomenon
commenced.</p>

<p class="sccaption">Figs. 12. and 13.</p></div>


<p><span class="pagenum">[201]</span><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>This cycle now plays itself off in the reverse order if the
speed of the rod is allowed gradually to decrease. The bands
appear first moving forward, then more slowly till they come to
rest, then moving backward until finally they relapse into confusion.</p>

<p>But let the rate of the rod be not decreased but always
steadily increased. The bands will reappear, this time three of
each color with six transition-bands. As before, the system at
first rotates backward, then lies still, and then moves forward
until it is dissolved. As the rod moves still faster, another system
appears, two bands of each color forming a diameter and
the two diameters lying at right angles. This system goes
through the same cycle of movements. When the increased
velocity of the rod destroys this system, another appears having
one band of each color, the two lying on opposite sides of the
center. The system goes through the same phases and is likewise
dissolved. Now, at this point the rod will be found to be
rotating at the same speed as the disc itself.</p>

<p>The explanation of the phenomenon is simple. The bands
are not produced by a single interruption of the vision of a sector
by a rod, but each band is made up of successive superpositions
on the retina of many such single-interruption bands. The
overlapping of bands has been already described (cf. Fig. 10
and <a href="#Page_196">pp. 196-198</a>); superposition depends of course on the same
principle.</p>

<p>At the moment when a system of four bands of either color
is seen at rest, the rod is moving just one fifth as rapidly as the
disc; so that, while the rod goes once around, either sector, say
the green one, will have passed behind it exactly four times,
and at points which lie 90&deg; apart. Thus, four red bands are
produced which lie at right angles to one another. But the
disc is revolving at least 24 times in a second, the rod therefore
<span class="pagenum">[202]</span><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>at least 4.8 times, so that within the interval of time during
which successive stimuli still contribute to the characteristic
effect the rod will have revolved several times, and with each
revolution four red bands at right angles to one another will
have been formed. And if the rod is moving <i>exactly</i> one fifth
as fast as the disc, each new band will be generated at exactly
that position on the disc where was the corresponding band of
the preceding four. The system of bands thus appear motionless
on the disc.</p>

<p>The movement of the system arises when the rate of the rod
is slightly less or more than one fifth that of the disc. If
slightly less, the bands formed at each rotation of the rod do
not lie precisely over those of the previous rotation, but a little
to the rear of them. The new set still lies mostly superposed
on the previous sets, and so fuses into a regular appearance of
bands, but, since each new increment lags a bit behind, the
entire system appears to rotate backward. The apparatus is
actually a cinematograph, but one which gives so many pictures
in the second that they entirely fuse and the strobic movement
has no trace of discontinuity.</p>

<p>If the rod moves a trifle more than one fifth as fast as the
disc, it is clear that the system of bands will rotate forward,
since each new set of bands will lie slightly ahead of the old
ones with which it fuses. The farther the ratio between the
rates of rod and disc departs from exactly 1:5, whether less or
greater, the more rapid will the strobic movement, backward or
forward, be; until finally the divergence is too great, the newly
forming bands lie too far ahead or behind those already formed
to fuse with them and so be apperceived as one system, and so
the bands are lost in confusion. Thus the cycle of movement
as observed on the disc is explained. As the rate of the rod
comes up to and passes one fifth that of the disc, the system of
four bands of each color forms in rapid backward rotation. Its
movement grows slower and slower, it comes to rest, then begins
to whirl forward, faster and faster, till it breaks up again.</p>

<p>The same thing happens as the rate of the rod reaches and
exceeds just one fourth that of the disc. The system contains
three bands of each color. The system of two bands of each
<span class="pagenum">[203]</span><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>color corresponds to the ratio 1:3 between the rates, while one
band of each color (the two lying opposite) corresponds to the
ratio 1:2.</p>

<p>If the rod and the disc rotate in opposite directions, the phenomena
are changed only in so far as the changed geometrical
relations require. For the ratio 1:3 between the two rates, the
strobic system has four bands of each color; for 1:2, three
bands of each color; while when the two rates are equal, there
are two bands of each color, forming a diameter. As would be
expected from the geometrical conditions, a system of one band
of each color cannot be generated when rod and disc have opposite
motions. For of course the rod cannot now hide two or
more times in succession a sector at any given point, without
hiding the same sector just as often at the opposite point, 180&deg;
away. Here, too, the cycle of strobic movements is different.
It is reversed. Let the disc be said to rotate forward, then if
the rate of the rod is slightly less than one fourth, etc., that of the
disc, the system will rotate forward; if greater, it will rotate backward.
So that as the rate of the rod increases, any system on
its appearance will move forward, then stand still, and lastly
rotate backward. The reason for this will be seen from an instant's
consideration of where the rod will hide a given sector.</p>

<p>It is clear that if, instead of using as 'rod' a single radial
sector, one were to rotate two or more such sectors disposed at
equal angular intervals about the axis, one would have the same
strobic phenomena, although they would be more complicated.
Indeed, a large number of rather narrow sectors can be used or,
what is the same thing, a second disc with a row of holes at
equal intervals about the circumference. The disc used by
the writer had a radius of 11 inches, and a concentric ring of
64 holes, each 3/8 of an inch in diameter, lying 10 inches from
the center. The observer looks through these holes at the
color-disc behind. The two discs need not be placed concentrically.</p>

<p>When produced in this way, the strobic illusion is exceedingly
pretty. Instead of straight, radial bands, one sees a
number of brightly colored balls lying within a curving band
of the other color and whirling backward or forward, or sometimes
<span class="pagenum">[204]</span><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>standing still. Then these break up and another set
forms, perhaps with the two colors changed about, and this then
oscillates one way or the other. A rainbow disc substituted for
the disc of two sectors gives an indescribably complicated and
brilliant effect; but the front disc must rotate more slowly. This
disc should in any case be geared for high speeds and should
be turned by hand for the sake of variations in rate, and consequently
in the strobic movement.</p>

<p>It has been seen that this stroboscope is not different in principle
from the illusion of the resolution-bands which this paper
has aimed to explain. The resolution-bands depend wholly
on the purely geometrical relations between the rod and the
disc, whereby as both move the rod hides one sector after the
other. The only physiological principles involved are the
familiar processes by which stimulations produce after-images,
and by which the after-images of rapidly succeeding stimulations
are summed, a certain number at a time, into a characteristic
effect.</p>

<h2><a name="MEM1" id="MEM1"></a>RECALL OF WORDS, OBJECTS AND MOVEMENTS.</h2>

<h4>BY HARVEY A. PETERSON.</h4>


<p>Kirkpatrick,<a name="FNanchor_1_73" id="FNanchor_1_73"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_1_73'>1</a> in experimenting with 379 school children and
college students, found that 3-1/3 times as many objects were
recalled as visual words after an interval of three days. The
experiment consisted in showing successively 10 written names
of common objects in the one case and 10 objects in the other at
the rate of one every two seconds. Three days later the persons
were asked to recall as many of each series as possible, putting
all of one series together. The averages thus obtained were
1.89 words, 6.29 objects. The children were not more dependent
on the objects than the college students.</p>

<p>Since the experiment just described was performed without
laboratory facilities, Calkins<a name="FNanchor_2_74" id="FNanchor_2_74"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_2_74'>2</a> repeated it with 50 college
women, substituting lantern pictures for objects. She obtained
in recall, after two days, the averages 4.82 words, 7.45 pictures.
The figures, however, are the number of objects or
words remembered out of ten, not necessarily correctly placed.
Kirkpatrick's corresponding figures for college women were
3.22 words, 5.44 objects. The two experiments substantially
agree, Calkins' higher averages being probably due to the shortening
of the interval to two days.</p>

<p>Assuming, thus, that objects are better remembered than
names in deferred recall, the question arises whether this holds
true when the objects and names are coupled with strange and
arbitrary symbols&mdash;a question which is clearly of great practical
interest from the educational point of view, as it is involved in
the pedagogical problem whether a person seeking to acquire
the vocabulary of a foreign language ought to connect the foreign
words with the familiar words or with the objects themselves.
And the further question arises: what are the facts in
<span class="pagenum">[208]</span><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>the case of movements instead of objects, and correspondingly
in that of verbs instead of nouns. Both questions are the problems
of the following investigation.</p>

<p>As foreign symbols, either the two-figure numbers were used
or nonsense-words of regularly varying length. As familiar
material, nouns, objects, verbs and movements were used. The
words were always concrete, not abstract, by which it is meant
that their meaning was capable of demonstration to the senses.
With the exception of a few later specified series they were
monosyllabic words. The nouns might denote objects of any
size perceptible to the eye; the objects, however, were all of
such a size that they could be shown through a 14&times;12 cm.
aperture and still leave a margin. Their size was therefore
limited.</p>

<p>Concerning the verbs and movements it is evident that, while
still being concrete, they might be simple or complicated activities
consuming little or much time, and further, might be movements
of parts of the body merely, or movements employing
other objects as well. In this experiment complicated activities
were avoided even in the verb series. Simple activities which
could be easily and quickly imaged or made were better for the
purpose in view.</p>

<h3>THE <i>A</i> SET.</h3>

<p>The <i>A</i> set contained sixteen series, <i>A<sup>1</sup></i>, <i>A<sup>2</sup></i>, <i>A<sup>3</sup></i>, etc., to <i>A<sup>16</sup></i>.
They were divided as follows:</p>

<div class="blkquot"><p>Numbers and nouns: <i>A<sup>1</sup></i>, <i>A<sup>5</sup></i>, <i>A<sup>9</sup></i>, <i>A<sup>13</sup></i>.</p>

<p>Numbers and objects: <i>A<sup>2</sup></i>, <i>A<sup>6</sup></i>, <i>A<sup>10</sup></i>, <i>A<sup>14</sup></i>.</p>

<p>Numbers and verbs: <i>A<sup>3</sup></i>, <i>A<sup>7</sup></i>, <i>A<sup>11</sup></i>, <i>A<sup>15</sup></i>.</p>

<p>Numbers and movements: <i>A<sup>4</sup></i>, <i>A<sup>8</sup></i>, <i>A<sup>12</sup></i>, <i>A<sup>16</sup></i>.</p>
</div>

<p>The first week <i>A<sup>1-4</sup></i> were given, the second week <i>A<sup>5-8</sup></i>, etc.,
so that each week one series of each of the four types was
given the subject.</p>

<p>In place of foreign symbols the numbers from 1 to 99 were
used, except in <i>A<sup>13-15</sup></i>, in which three-figure numbers were used.</p>

<p>Each series contained seven couplets, except <i>A<sup>13-16</sup></i>, which,
on account of the greater difficulty of three-figure numbers,
<span class="pagenum">[209]</span><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>contained five. Each couplet was composed of a number and
a noun, object, verb, or movement.</p>

<p>Certain rules were observed in the composition of the series.
Since the test was for permanence, to avoid confusion no
number was used in more than one couplet. No two numbers
of a given series were chosen from the same decade or contained
identical final figures. No word was used in more than
one couplet. Their vowels, and initial and final consonants
were so varied within a single series as to eliminate phonetic
aids, viz., alliteration, rhyme, and assonance. The kind of assonance
avoided was identity of final sounded consonants in
successive words, <i>e.g.</i>, lane, vine.</p>

<p>The series were composed in the following manner: After
the twenty-eight numbers for four series had been chosen, the
words which entered a given series were selected one from each
of a number of lists of words. These lists were words of like-sounded
vowels. After one word had been chosen from each
list, another was taken from the first list, etc. As a consequence
of observing the rules by which alliteration, rhyme,
and assonance were eliminated, the words of a series usually
represented unlike categories of thought, but where two words
naturally tended to suggest each other one of them was rejected
and the next eligible word in the same column was chosen.
The following is a typical series from the <i>A</i> set.</p>


<div class="center"><table summary="Numbers/Nouns" cellspacing="10">
<colgroup span="7" align="center"></colgroup>
<tr><th colspan="7" align="center"><i>A<sup>1</sup></i>. Numbers and Nouns.</th></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>42</td><td>87</td><td>74</td><td>11</td><td>63</td><td>38</td></tr>
<tr><td>desk</td><td>girl</td><td>pond</td><td>muff</td><td>lane</td><td>hoop</td><td>vine</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The apparatus used in the <i>A</i> set and also in all the later sets
may be described as follows: Across the length of a table ran
a large, black cardboard screen in the center of which was an
oblong aperture 14 cm. high and 12 cm. wide. The center of
the aperture was on a level with the eyes of the subject, who sat
at the table. The aperture was opened and closed by a pneumatic
shutter fastened to the back of the screen. This shutter
consisted of two doors of black cardboard sliding to either side.
By means of a large bulb the length of exposure could be regulated
by the operator, who stood behind the table.<span class="pagenum">[210]</span><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a></p>

<p>The series&mdash;consisting of cards 4&times;2&frac12; cm., each containing
a printed couplet&mdash;was carried on a car which moved on a
track behind and slightly below the aperture. The car was
a horizontal board 150 cm. long and 15 cm. wide, fixed on two
four-wheeled trucks. It was divided by vertical partitions of
black cardboard into ten compartments, each slightly wider than
the aperture to correspond with the visual angle. A curtain
fastened to the back of the car afforded a black background to
the compartments. The couplets were supported by being
inserted into a groove running the length of the car, 3 cm.
from the front. A shutter 2 cm. high also running the length
of the car in front of the groove, fastened by hinges whose
free arms were extensible, concealed either the upper or the
lower halves of the cards at the will of the operator; <i>i.e.</i>,
either the foreign symbols or the words, respectively. A screen
15 cm. high and the same length as the car, sliding in vertical
grooves just behind the cards and in front of the vertical partitions,
shut off the objects when desired, leaving only the cards
in view. Thus the apparatus could be used for all four types of
series.</p>

<p>The method of presentation and the time conditions of the
<i>A</i> set were as follows:&mdash;A metronome beating seconds was
used. It was kept in a sound-proof box and its loudness was
therefore under control. It was just clearly audible to both
operator and subject. In learning, each couplet was exposed
3 secs., during about 2 secs. of which the shutter was fully
open and motionless. During this time the subject read the
couplet inaudibly as often as he wished, but usually in time
with the metronome. His object was to associate the terms of
the couplet. There was an interval of 2 secs. after the exposure
of each couplet, and this was required to be filled with repetition
of only the <i>immediately preceding couplet</i>. After the
series had been presented once there was an interval of 2 secs.
additional, then a second presentation of it commenced and
after that a third. At the completion of the third presentation
there was an interval of 6 secs. additional instead of the 2, at
the expiration of which the test commenced.</p>

<p><i>A<sup>13-16</sup></i> had five presentations instead of three.<span class="pagenum">[211]</span><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>
The test consisted in showing the subject either the numbers
or the words in altered order and requiring him to write
as many of the absent terms as he could. In the object and
movement series the objects were also shown and the movements
repeated by the subject if words were the given terms. The
time conditions in the test were,</p>


<div class="center"><table  width="40%" summary="">
<colgroup span="2"><col align="left"  /><col align="right" /></colgroup>
<tr><td>Exposure of a term</td><td>3 secs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Post-term interval in A<sup>1-12</sup></td><td>4 secs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Post-term interval in A<sup>13-16</sup></td><td>6 secs.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>This allowed the subject 7 secs. for recalling and writing
each term in A<sup>1-12</sup> and 9 sec. in A<sup>13-16</sup>. If a word was recalled
after that time it was inserted, but no further insertions were
made after the test of a series had been completed. An interval
of 3 min. elapsed between the end of the test of one series
and the beginning of the next series, during which the subject
recorded the English word of any couplet in which an indirect
association had occurred, and also his success in obtaining
visual images if the series was a noun or a verb series.</p>

<p>As already indicated, four series&mdash;a noun, an object, a verb,
and a movement series&mdash;given within a half hour, constituted
a day's work throughout the year. Thus variations due to
changes in the physiological condition of the subject had to affect
all four types of series.</p>

<p>Two days later these series were tested for permanence,
and in the same way as the tests for immediate recall, with this
exception:</p>

<div class="center"><table  width="40%" summary="">
<tr><td>Post-term interval in A<sup>13-16</sup></td><td>8 secs.</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>Thus 11 secs. were allowed for the deferred recall of each
term in A<sup>13-16</sup>.</p>

<p>In the movement series of this set, to avoid hesitation and
confusion, the operator demonstrated to the subject immediately
before the series began, once for each word, how the movements
were to be made.</p>

<p>The <i>A</i> set was given to three subjects. The results of each
subject are arranged separately in the following table. In the
tests the words were required in A<sup>1-4</sup>, in A<sup>5-16</sup> the numbers.
The figures show the number of terms correctly recalled out of
seven couplets in A<sup>1-12</sup> and out of five couplets in A<sup>13-16</sup>, <i>exclusive</i><span class="pagenum">[212]</span><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>
of indirect association couplets. The figures in brackets indicate
the number of correctly recalled couplets per series in which
indirect associations occurred. The total number correctly recalled
in any series is their sum. The figures in the per cent.
row give the percentage of correctly recalled couplets left after
discarding both from the number recalled and from the total
number of couplets given those in which indirect associations
occurred. This simply diminished the subject's number of
chances. A discussion of the propriety of this elimination will
be found later. In <i>A<sup>1-12</sup></i> the absent terms had to be recalled
exactly in order, to be correct, but in <i>A<sup>13-16</sup></i>, on account of the
greater difficulty of the three-place numbers, any were considered
correct when two of the three figures were recalled, or
when all three figures were correct but two were reversed in
position, <i>e.g.</i>, 532 instead of 523. <i>N</i> means noun series, <i>O</i>
object, <i>V</i> verb, and <i>M</i> movement series. Series <i>A<sup>1</sup></i>, <i>A<sup>5</sup></i>, <i>A<sup>9</sup></i>,
<i>A<sup>13</sup></i> are to be found in the first and third columns, <i>A<sup>2</sup></i>, <i>A<sup>6</sup></i>, <i>A<sup>10</sup></i>,
<i>A<sup>14</sup></i> in the second and fourth, <i>A<sup>3</sup></i>, <i>A<sup>7</sup></i>, <i>A<sup>11</sup></i>, <i>A<sup>15</sup></i>, in the fifth and
seventh, and <i>A<sup>4</sup></i>, <i>A<sup>8</sup></i>, <i>A<sup>12</sup></i>, <i>A<sup>16</sup></i> in the sixth and eighth columns.</p>

<p>These results will be included in the discussion of the results
of the <i>B</i> set.</p>

<h3>THE <i>B</i> SET.</h3>

<p>A new material was needed for foreign symbols. After
considerable experimentation nonsense words were found to be
the best adapted for our purpose. The reasons for this are
their regularly varying length and their comparative freedom
from indirect associations. An objection to using nonsense syllables
in any work dealing with the permanence of memory is
their sameness. On this account they are not remembered
long. To secure a longer retention of the material, nonsense
words were devised in substantially the same manner as that in
which M&uuml;ller and Schumann made nonsense syllables, except
that these varied regularly in length from four to six letters.
Thus the number of letters, not the number of syllables was
the criterion of variation, though of course irregular variation
in the number of syllables was a necessary consequence.</p>

<p>When the nonsense words were used it was found that far
fewer indirect associations occurred than with nonsense syllables.
By indirect association I mean the association of a
foreign symbol and its word by means of a third term suggested
to the subject by either of the others and connected at
least in <i>his</i> experience with both. Usually this third term is a
word phonetically similar to the foreign symbol and ideationally
suggestive of the word to be associated. It is a very common
form of mnemonic in language material. The following are
examples:</p>

<div class="blkquot"><p>cax, stone (Caxton);<br />
teg, bib (get bib);<br />
laj, girl (large girl);<br />
xug, pond (noise heard from a pond);<br />
gan, mud (gander mud).</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[214]</span><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>For both of these reasons nonsense words were the material
used as foreign symbols in the <i>B</i> set.</p>

<p>The nonsense words were composed in the following manner.
From a box containing four of each of the vowels and
two of each of the consonants the letters were chosen by chance
for a four-letter, a five-letter, and a six-letter word in turn.
The letters were then returned to the box, mixed, and three
more words were composed. At the completion of a set of
twelve any which were not readily pronounceable or were
words or noticeably suggested words were rejected and others
composed in their places.</p>

<p>The series of the <i>B</i> set were four couplets long. Each series
contained one three-letter, one four-letter, one five-letter, and
one six-letter nonsense word. The position in the series occupied
by each kind was constantly varied. In all other respects
the same principles were followed in constructing the <i>B</i> set as
were observed in the <i>A</i> set with the following substitutions:</p>

<p>No two foreign symbols of a series and no two terms of a
couplet contained the same sounded vowel in accented syllables.</p>

<p>The rule for the avoidance of alliteration, rhyme, and assonance
was extended to the foreign symbols, and to the two
terms of a couplet.</p>

<p>The English pronounciation was used in the nonsense words.
The subjects were not informed what the nonsense words were.
They were called foreign words.</p>

<p>Free body movements were used in the movement series
as in the <i>A</i> set. Rarely an object was involved, <i>e.g.</i>, the
table on which the subject wrote. The movements were
demonstrated to the subject in advance of learning, as in the
<i>A</i> set.</p>

<p>The following are typical <i>B</i> series:</p>

<div class="center"><table summary="B series words" cellspacing="5">

</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[215]</span><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>The time conditions for presenting a series remained practically
the same. In learning, the series was shown three times
as before. The interval between learning and testing was
shortened to 4 seconds, and in the test the post-term interval of
<i>A<sup>13-16</sup></i> retained (6 secs.). This allowed the subject 9 secs.
for recalling and writing each term. The only important
change was an extension of the number of tests from two to
four. The third test was one week after the second, and the
fourth one week after the third. In these tests the familiar
word was always the term required, as in <i>A<sup>1-4</sup></i>, on account of
the difficulty of dealing statistically with the nonsense words.
The intervals for testing permanence in the <i>B</i> set may be most
easily understood by giving the time record of one subject.</p>

<p>The two half-hours in a week during which all the work of
one subject was done fell on approximately the same part of the
day. When a number of groups of 4 series each were to be
tested on a given day they were taken in the order of their
recency of learning. Thus on March 7 the order for <i>Hu</i> was
<i>B<sup>13-16</sup></i>, <i>B<sup>9-12</sup></i>, <i>B<sup>5-8</sup></i>.</p>

<p>Henceforth there was also rotation within a given four series.
As there were always sixteen series in a set, the effects of practice
and fatigue within a given half-hour were thus eliminated.</p>

<p>In the following table the results of the <i>B</i> set are given. Its
arrangement is the same as in Table 1., except that the figures
indicate the number of absent terms correctly recalled out of four
couplets instead of seven or five. Where blanks occur, the
series was discontinued on account of lack of recall. As in
Table 1., the tables in the first, third and fifth columns show successive
stages of the same series. Immediate recall is omitted
because with rare exceptions it was perfect, the test being given
merely as an aid in learning.<span class="pagenum">[216]</span><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a></p>

<p>The first question which occurs in examining the foregoing
tables is concerning the method of treating the indirect associations,
<i>i.e.</i>, obtaining the per cents. The number of couplets
correctly recalled may be divided into two classes: those in
which indirect associations did not occur, and those in which
they did occur. Those in which they did not occur furnish us
exactly what we want, for they are results which are entirely
free from indirect associations. In them, therefore, a comparison
can be made between series using objects and activities
and others using images. On the other hand, those correctly
recalled couplets in which indirect associations <i>did</i> occur are
not for our purposes pure material, for they contain not only
the object-image factor but the indirect association factor also.<span class="pagenum">[219]</span><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>
The solution is to eliminate these latter couplets, <i>i.e.</i>, subtract
them both from the number correctly recalled and from the
total number of couplets in the set for a given subject. By so
doing and by dividing the first remainder by the second the
per cents, in the tables were obtained. There is one exception
to this treatment. The few couplets in which indirect associations
occurred but which were nevertheless <i>incorrectly</i> recalled
are subtracted only from the total number of couplets in the set.</p>

<p>The method by which the occurrence of indirect associations
was recorded has been already described. It is considered
entirely trustworthy. There is usually little doubt in the mind
of a subject who comprehends what is meant by an indirect
association whether or not such were present in the particular
series which has just been learned. If none occurred in it the
subjects always recorded the fact. That an indirect association
should occasionally be present on one day and absent on a
subsequent one is not strange. That a second term should
effect a union between a first and third and thereafter disappear
from consciousness is not an uncommon phenomenon of association.
There were thirteen such cases out of sixty-eight indirect
associations in the <i>A</i>, <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> sets. In the tables they
are given as present because their effects are present. When
the reverse was the case, namely, when an indirect association
occurred on the second, ninth or sixteenth day for the first
time, it aided in later recall and was counted thereafter. There
were eight such cases among the sixty-eight indirect associations.</p>

<p>Is it possible that the occurrence of indirect associations
in, <i>e.g.</i>, two of the four couplets of a series renders the retention
of the other two easier? This could only be so when the
intervals between two couplets in learning were used for
review, but such was never the case. The subjects were required
to fill such intervals with repetitions of the preceding
couplet only.</p>

<p>The elimination of the indirect association couplets and the
acceptance of the remainders as fair portrayals of the influence
of objects and movements on recall is therefore a much nearer
approach to truth than would be the retention of the indirectly
associated couplets.<span class="pagenum">[220]</span><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a></p>

<p>The following conclusions deal with recall after two days
only. The recall after longer intervals will be discussed after
Table III.</p>

<p>The summary from Tables I. and II. shows that when objects
and nouns are coupled each with a foreign symbol, four of the
six subjects recall real objects better than images of objects,
while two, <i>M</i> and <i>Ho</i>, show little or no preference. The
summary also shows that when body movements and verbs are
coupled each with a foreign symbol, five of the six subjects
recall actual movements better than images of movements, while
one subject, <i>M</i>, shows no preference. The same subject also
showed no preference for objects. With the subjects <i>S</i> and <i>B</i>
the preference for actual movements is not marked, and has
importance only in the light of later experiments to be reported.</p>

<p>The great difference in the retentive power of different
subjects is, as we should expect, very evident. Roughly, they
may be divided into two groups. <i>M</i> and <i>Mo</i> recall much
more than the other four. The small percentage of recall in
the case of these four suggested the next change in the conditions
of experimentation, namely, to shorten with them the
intervals between the tests for permanence. This was accordingly
done in the <i>C</i> set. But before giving an account of the
next set we may supplement these results by results obtained
from other subjects.</p>

<p>It was impossible to repeat this set with the same subjects,
and inconvenient, on account of the scarcity of suitable words,
to devise another set just like it. Accordingly, the <i>B</i> set was
repeated with six new subjects. We may interpolate the results
here, and then resume our experiments with the other subjects.
The conditions remained the same as for the other subjects in
all respects except the following. The tests after nine and sixteen
days were omitted, and the remaining test for deferred
recall was given after one day instead of after two. In learning
the series, each series was shown four times instead of three.
The results are summarized in the following table. The figures
in the left half show the number of words out of sixteen which
were correctly recalled. The figures in parentheses separate,
as before, the correctly recalled indirect-association couplets.<span class="pagenum">[221]</span><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>
In the right half of the table the same results, omitting indirect-association
couplets, are given in per cents, to facilitate comparison
with the summary from Tables I. and II.</p>

<p>The table shows that five subjects recall objects better than
images of objects, while one subject recalls images of objects
better. Similarly, three subjects recall actual movements of
the body better than images of the same, while with three neither
type has any advantage.</p>

<h3>THE <i>C</i> SET.</h3>

<p>In the <i>C</i> set certain conditions were different from the conditions
of the <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> sets. These changes will be described
under three heads: changes in the material; changes in the
time conditions; and changes in the method of presentation.</p>

<p>For lack of monosyllabic English words the verbs and movements
were dissyllabic words. The nouns and objects were
monosyllabic, as before. All were still concrete, and the movements,
whether made or imaged, were still simple. But the
movements employed objects, instead of being merely movements
of the body.</p>

<p>For two of the subjects, <i>M</i> and <i>Mo</i>, the time intervals between
the tests remained as in the <i>A</i> and the <i>B</i> sets, namely,
two days, nine days, and sixteen days. With the four other
subjects, <i>S</i>, <i>Hu</i>, <i>B</i> and <i>Ho</i>, the number of tests was reduced
to three and the intervals were as follows:</p>

<p>The I. test, which as before was a part of the learning process,
was not counted. The II. test followed from 4&frac12; to 6&frac12;
hours, or an average of 5-3/8 hours, after the I. test. The III.<span class="pagenum">[222]</span><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>
test was approximately 16 hours after the II. test for all four
subjects.</p>

<p>The series were learned between 10 a.m. and 1:30 p.m.,
the II. test was the same day between 4:30 and 5:10 p.m., and
the III. test was the following morning between 8:30 and 9:10
a.m. Each subject of course came at the same hour each week.</p>

<p>Each series was shown three times, as in the <i>B</i> set.</p>

<p>A change had to be made in the length of exposure of each
couplet in the movement series. For, as a rule, movements
employing objects required a longer time to execute than mere
movements of the body. Five seconds was found to be a suitable
length of exposure. To keep the three other types of
series comparable with the movement series, if possible, their
exposure was also increased from 3 to 5 secs. The interval of
2 secs, at the end of a presentation was omitted, and the interval
between learning and testing reduced from 4 secs, in the <i>B</i>
set to 2 secs.</p>

<p>In the movement series of the <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> sets, movements
of parts of the body were chosen. But the number of such
movements which a person can conveniently make while reading
words shown through an aperture is limited, and as stated
above no single word was ever used in two couplets. These
were now exhausted. In the <i>C</i> set, therefore, movements employing
objects were substituted. The objects lay on the table
in a row in front of the subject, occupying a space about 50
cm. from left to right, and were covered by a black cambric
cloth. They were thus all exposed at the same moment by the
subject who, at a signal, laid back the cloth immediately before
the series began, and in the same manner covered them at the
end of the third presentation. Thus the objects were or might
be all in view at once, and as a result the subject usually
formed a single mental image of the four objects.</p>

<p>With this kind of material it was no longer necessary for the
operator to show the subject in advance of the series what the
movements were in order to avoid hesitation and confusion, for
the objects were of such a nature as obviously to suggest in connection
with the words the proper movements.<span class="pagenum">[223]</span><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a></p>

<p>The object series were also changed to conform to the movement
series. Formerly the objects had been shown successively
through the aperture and synchronously with their corresponding
words; now they were on the table in front of the subject and
all uncovered and covered at once as in the movement series.
The subjects therefore had a single mental image of these four
objects also.</p>

<p>In both the object and the movement series the objects as
before were small and fairly uniform in size and so selected as
not to betray to the subject their presence beneath the cloth in
the I. test. In the II., III. and IV. tests there were no objects
on the table.<span class="pagenum">[225]</span><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a></p>

<p>Before asking whether the results of the <i>C</i> set confirm the
conclusions already reached, we must compare the conditions
of the three sets to see whether the changes in the conditions
in the <i>C</i> set have rendered it incomparable with the other two.
The first change was the substitution of dissyllabic words in the
verb and the movement series in the place of monosyllabic
words. Since the change was made in both the verb and
the movement series their comparability with each other is
not interfered with, and this is the point at issue. Preliminary
tests, however, made it highly probable that simple concrete
dissyllabic words are not more difficult than monosyllabic in 5
secs. exposure. This change is therefore disregarded.</p>

<p>The first important change introduced in the <i>C</i> set was the
reduction of the intervals between the tests for four subjects.
The second was the lengthening of the exposure from 3 to 5
secs. These changes also do not lessen the comparability of
the noun, object, verb and movement series with one another,
since they affected all series of the <i>C</i> set.</p>

<p>The third change in the conditions was the substitution in
the movement series of movements employing objects for movements
of the body alone, and the consequent placing of objects
<span class="pagenum">[226]</span><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>on the table in the movement and in the object series of which
the subject obtained a single mental image. All of the subjects
were of the opinion that this single mental image was an
aid in recall. Each of the objects contributing to form it was
individualized by its spatial order among the objects on the
table. The objects shown through the aperture were connected
merely by temporal contiguity. On this account the object and
the movement series of the <i>C</i> set are not altogether comparable
with those of the <i>A</i> and the <i>B</i> sets. We should expect <i>a priori</i>
that the object and the movement series in the <i>C</i> set would
be much better recalled than those of the <i>A</i> and the <i>B</i> sets.</p>

<p>The fourth change was from imaged or made movements of
the body alone to imaged or made movements employing objects.
If, as the <i>A</i> and the <i>B</i> sets have already demonstrated,
the presence of objects at all is an aid to recall, the movement
series of the <i>C</i> set should show a greater gain over their corresponding
verb series than the simple movements of the body in
the <i>A</i> and the <i>B</i> sets showed over their corresponding verb
series. For, employing objects in movements is adding the aid
of objects to whatever aid there is in making the movements.</p>

<p>Turning to the results, we consider the <i>C</i> set by itself with
reference to the effect of the use of objects vs. images in general.
The summary from Table IV. shows that under the conditions
given, after intervals of from slightly less than one day
to two days, five of the six subjects recall object couplets better
than noun couplets. One subject, <i>M</i> recalls noun couplets
better. It also shows that under the conditions and after the
intervals mentioned all six subjects recall movement couplets
better than verb couplets. In view of the small difference here
and of his whole record, however, <i>M</i> is probably to be classed
as indifferent in both substantive and action series.</p>

<h3>RECALL AFTER NINE AND SIXTEEN DAYS.</h3>

<p>Thus far recall after these longer intervals has not been discussed.
The experiment was originally devised to test recall
after two days only, but it was found that with two of the subjects,
<i>M</i> and <i>Mo</i>, recall for greater intervals could be obtained
with slight additional trouble. This was accordingly done in
<span class="pagenum">[227]</span><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>the <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> sets. The results of the four other subjects in the
<i>B</i> set are not so satisfactory on this point, because not enough
was recalled.</p>

<p>The most interesting fact which developed was an apparently
slower rate of forgetting, in many cases, of the nouns and
verbs than of the objects and movements. In the noun-object
group of the <i>B</i> set it is noticeable in three out of the four possible
subjects, viz., <i>B, Ho</i>, and <i>Mo</i>. <i>M</i> alone does not show
it. The two other subjects, <i>S</i> and <i>B</i>, did not recall enough
for a comparison. In the verb-movement group of the <i>B</i> set it
is also marked in three out of the four possible subjects, viz.,
<i>M</i>, <i>Ho</i>, and <i>Mo. B</i> alone does not show it. It is also seen
in the <i>C</i> set in the results of <i>M</i> and <i>Mo</i>, in both the noun-object
and the verb-movement groups. With the four other
subjects in the <i>C</i> set it could not be noticed, since the series ran
their course in a day. In <i>M</i> (verb-movement group, <i>C</i> set)
and <i>Mo</i> (noun-object group, <i>C</i> set) the originally higher object
or movement curves actually fall below their corresponding
noun or verb curves.</p>

<p>The results of the tests for recall after nine and sixteen days
are summarized in the following tables. They should be compared
with the recall of these same series after two days given
in Tables II. and IV., nor should it be forgotten that all four
types started with perfect immediate recall. The figures give
per cents, correct after eliminating indirect-association couplets.</p>

<h3>THE <i>D</i> SET.</h3>

<p>A few series of nouns, objects, verbs, and movements dissociated
from foreign symbols were obtained. The material
was of the same kind as the words used in the couplet series,
being mostly monosyllabic and seldom dissyllabic words. They
had not been previously used with these subjects. Each series
contained ten words or ten objects. The same kind of precautions
were taken as in the couplet sets to avoid phonetic aids
and the juxtaposition of words which suggest each other. The
apparatus employed in the couplet sets was used. The objects
in the object series were shown through the aperture. Visual
images were required in the noun and in the verb series. The
noun and the object series were exposed at the rate of one word
every 2 secs. (or 20 secs. for the series) for <i>M</i>, <i>S</i>, and <i>Hu</i>,
and one every 3 secs. (or 30 secs. for the series) for <i>B</i>, <i>Ho</i>,
and <i>Mo</i>. Only one exposure of the series was given. At its
completion the subject at once wrote as many of the words or
objects as he could recall. Two days later at the same hour
he was asked to write without further stimulus as many words
of each series as he could recall, classifying them according to
their type of series.</p>

<p>The verbs were similar to the verbs of the couplet series.
There was a tendency in the verb series among most of the
subjects to make a more or less connected story of the verbs
and thus some subjects could retain all ten words for two days.
This was an element not present in the couplet verb series,
according to the subjects, nor in any other series, and the subjects
were, therefore, directed to eliminate it by imaging each
action in a different place and connected with different persons.
The effort was nearly successful, some of the subjects connecting
two or three verbs, and others none. The movements
employed ten objects which were uncovered and covered by
<span class="pagenum">[229]</span><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>the subject as in the <i>C</i> set. The exposure for the verbs and
movements was 5 secs. for each word, or 50 secs. for the series.
The tests were the same as in the series of ten nouns and ten
objects, but in a number of cases (to be specified in the table) it
seemed best to shorten the interval for deferred recall to one
day.</p>

<p>The series were always given in pairs&mdash;a noun and an
object series, or a verb and a movement series forming a pair.
Only one pair was given per day and no other series of any
kind were given on that day. Usually several days intervened
between the II. test of one pair and the learning of the next, but
in a little less than half of the cases a new pair was learned on
the same day shortly after the II. test of the preceding pair.</p>

<p>The noun-object pairs and the verb-movement pairs were
not given in any definite order with reference to each other.</p>

<p>The figures in the following table indicate the number of
words out of ten which the subject correctly recalled and placed
in their proper columns. Immediate recall is also given.</p>

<p class="tblexp">&sup1; One day.</p>

<p>The results of the <i>D</i> set strongly confirm the results of the
<i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>C</i> sets. Table VII. shows that after from one to two
days' interval four subjects recall objects better than nouns and
movements better than verbs. One subject, <i>M.</i>, shows no preference.</p>


<h3>CONCLUSIONS.</h3>

<p>We are now in a position to answer specifically the problem
of this investigation. The results show: (1) that those five subjects
who recall objects better than nouns (involving images)
<i>when each occurs alone</i>, also recall objects better than nouns
when each is recalled by means of an unfamiliar verbal symbol
with which it has been coupled; (2) that the same is true of
verbs and movements; (3) that these facts also receive confirmation
on the negative side, viz.: the one subject who does not
recall objects and movements better than nouns and verbs (involving
images) <i>when they are used alone</i>, also does not recall
them better <i>when they are recalled by means of foreign symbols</i>
with which they have been coupled.</p>

<h3>MINOR QUESTIONS.</h3>

<p>The problem proposed at the outset of the investigation
having been answered, two minor questions remain: (1) as to
images, (2) indirect associations.</p>

<p>1. All the subjects were good visualizers. The images
became clear usually during the first of the three presentations,<span class="pagenum">[231]</span><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>
<i>i.e.</i>, in 1-3 secs., and persisted until the next couplet appeared.
In the second and third presentations the same images recurred,
rarely a new one appeared.</p>

<p>An interesting side light is thrown on M.'s memory by his
work in another experiment in which he was a subject. This
experiment required that the subject look at an object for 10
secs. and then after the disappearance of its after-image manipulate
the memory image. M. showed unusually persistent after-images.
The memory images which followed were unusually
clear in details and also persistent. They were moreover retained
for weeks, as was shown by his surprising ability to recall the
details of an image long past, and separated from the present
one by many subsequent images. His memory was capacious
rather than selective. His eyesight was tested and found to be
normal for the range of the apparatus. Possibly his age (55
yrs.) is significant, although one of the two subjects who showed
the greatest preference for objects and movements, Mo., was
only six yrs. younger. The ages of the other subjects were S.
36 yrs., Hu. 23 yrs., B. 25 yrs., Ho. 27 yrs.</p>

<p>That some if not all of the subjects did not have objective
images in many of the noun and verb couplets if they were left
to their own initiative to obtain them is evident from the image
records in the <i>A</i> set, in which the presence of the objective
images was optional but the record obligatory. The same subject
might have in one noun or verb series no visual images and in
another he might have one for every couplet of the series. After
the completion of the <i>A</i> set, the effect of the presence of the objective
images in series of 10 nouns alone, or 10 objects alone
after two days' interval, was tested. This was merely a repetition
of similar work by Kirkpatrick after three days' interval, and
yielded similar results. As a matter of fact some of the subjects
were unable wholly to exclude the objective images, but were
compelled to admit and then suppress them as far as possible, so
that it is really a question of degree of prominence and duration
of the images.</p>

<p>The presence of the objective images having been shown to
be an aid in the case of series of nouns, the subjects were
henceforth requested to obtain them in the noun and verb series
<span class="pagenum">[232]</span><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>of the <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> sets, and the image records show that they were
entirely successful in doing so.</p>

<p>2. The total number of couplets in any one or in several sets
may be divided into two classes: (1) Those in which indirect
associations did not occur in the learning, and (2) those in
which they did occur. For reasons already named we may
call the first pure material and the second mixed. We can
then ascertain in each the proportion of correctly recalled
couplets after one, two, nine and sixteen days' interval, and
thus see the importance of indirect associations as a factor in
recall. This is what has been done in the following table.</p>

<p>The figures give the number of couplets correctly or incorrectly
recalled out of 64. In the case of the interval of one day
the figures are a tabulation of the III. test (twenty-one hours) of
the <i>C</i> set, which contained 16 series of 4 couplets each. The
figures for the intervals of two, nine and sixteen days are a
tabulation of the <i>B</i> set, which also contained 16 series of 4
couplets each. <i>C</i> denotes correct, <i>I</i> incorrect.</p>

<p>We see from the table that the likelihood of recalling couplets
in which indirect associations did not occur in learning is 63
per cent. after one day, and that there is a diminution of 44 per
cent. in the next fifteen days. The fall is greatest during the
second day. On the other hand, the likelihood of recalling
couplets in which indirect associations did occur is 82 per cent.
after one day, and there is a diminution of only 18 per cent.<span class="pagenum">[233]</span><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>
during the next fifteen days. The fading is also much more
gradual.</p>

<p>It is evident, then, that in all investigations dealing with
language material the factor of indirect associations&mdash;a largely
accidental factor affecting varying amounts of the total material
(in these six subjects from 3 per cent. to 23 per cent.) is by far
the most influential of all the factors, and any investigations
which have heretofore failed to isolate it are not conclusive as
to other factors.</p>

<p>The practical value of the foregoing investigation will be
found in its bearing upon the acquisition of language. While
it is by no means confined to the acquisition of the vocabulary
of a <i>foreign</i> language, but is also applicable to the acquisition
of the vocabulary of the native language, it is the former bearing
which is perhaps more obvious. If it is important that one become
able as speedily as possible to grasp the meaning of foreign
words, the results of the foregoing investigation indicate the
method one should adopt.</p>

<h2><a name="MEM2" id="MEM2"></a>MUTUAL INHIBITION OF MEMORY IMAGES.</h2>

<h4>BY FREDERICK MEAKIN.</h4>

<p>The results here presented are the record of a preliminary
inquiry rather than a definitive statement of principles.</p>

<p>The effort to construct a satisfactory theory of inhibition has
given rise, in recent years, to a good deal of discussion. Ever
since it was discovered that the reflexes of the spinal cord are
normally modified or restrained by the activity of the brain and
Setschenow (1863) attempted to prove the existence of localized
inhibition centers, the need of such a theory has been felt. The
discussion, however, has been mainly physiological, and we
cannot undertake to follow it here. The psychologist may not
be indifferent, of course, to any comprehensive theory of nervous
action. He works, indeed, under a general presumption
which takes for granted a constant and definite relation between
psychical and cerebral processes. But pending the settlement
of the physiological question he may still continue with the
study of facts to which general expression may be given under
some theory of psychical inhibition not inconsistent with the
findings of the physiologist.</p>

<p>A question of definition, however, confronts us here. Can
we, it may be asked, speak of psychical inhibition at all?
Does one conscious state exercise pressure on another, either to
induce it, or to expel it from the field? 'Force' and 'pressure,'
however pertinent to physical inquiries, are surely out of
place in an investigation of the relations between the phenomena
of mind. Plainly a distinction has to be made if we are to
carry over the concept of inhibition from the domain of nervous
activity to the conscious domain. Inhibition cannot, it should
seem, have the same sense in both. We find, accordingly, that
Baldwin, who defines nervous inhibition as 'interference with
the normal result of a nervous excitement by an opposing force,'
says of mental inhibition that it 'exists in so far as the occurrence
of a mental process prevents the simultaneous occurrence
<span class="pagenum">[236]</span><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>of other mental processes which might otherwise take
place.'<a name="FNanchor_1_75" id="FNanchor_1_75"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_1_75'>1</a></p>

<p>Even here, it may be said, there is in the term 'prevents'
an implication of the direct exercise of force. But if we abstract
from any such implication, and conceive of such force as
the term inhibition seems to connote, as restricted to the associated
neural or physiological processes, no unwarranted assumptions
need be imported by the term into the facts, and the definition
may, perhaps, suffice.</p>

<p>Some careful work has been done in the general field of
psychical inhibition. In fact, the question of inhibition could
hardly be avoided in any inquiry concerning attention or volition.
A. Binet<a name="FNanchor_2_76" id="FNanchor_2_76"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_2_76'>2</a> reports certain experiments in regard to the
rivalry of conscious states. But the states considered were more
properly those of attention and volition than of mere ideation.
And the same author reports later<a name="FNanchor_3_77" id="FNanchor_3_77"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_3_77'>3</a> examples of antagonism between
images and sensations, showing how the latter may be
affected, and in some respects inhibited, by the former. But
this is inhibition of sensations rather than of ideas. Again,
Binet, in collaboration with Victor Henri,<a name="FNanchor_4_78" id="FNanchor_4_78"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_4_78'>4</a> reports certain inhibitory
effects produced in the phenomena of speech. But here
again the material studied was volitional. More recently, G.
Heymans<a name="FNanchor_5_79" id="FNanchor_5_79"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_5_79'>5</a> has made elaborate investigation of a certain phase of
'psychische Hemmung,' and showed how the threshold of perception
may be raised, for the various special senses, by the
interaction of rival sensations, justly contending that this shifting
of the threshold measures the degree in which the original
sensation is inhibited by its rival. But the field of inquiry was
in that case strictly sensational. We find also a discussion by
Robert Saxinger,<a name="FNanchor_6_80" id="FNanchor_6_80"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_6_80'>6</a> 'Ueber den Einfluss der Gef&uuml;hle auf die
Vorstellungsbewegung.' But the treatment there, aside from<span class="pagenum">[237]</span><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>
the fact that it deals with the emotions, is theoretical rather than
experimental.</p>

<p>In short, it appears that though much has been said and
done upon the general subject of psychical inhibition, experimental
inquiry into the inhibitory effect of one idea upon another&mdash;abstraction
made, as far as possible, of all volitional influence&mdash;virtually
introduces us to a new phase of the subject.</p>

<p>The term 'idea,' it should be noted, is here used in its
broadest sense, and includes the memory image. In fact, the
memory image and its behavior in relation to another memory
image formed the material of the first part of the research,
which alone is reported here. Apparatus and method were
both very simple.</p>

<p>The ideas to be compared were suggested by geometrical
figures cut out of pasteboard and hung, 25 cm. apart, upon a
small black stand placed on a table in front of the observer,
who sat at a distance of four feet from the stand. The diagrams
and descriptions which follow will show the character of
these figures.</p>

<p>Before the figures were placed in position, the subject was
asked to close his eyes. The figures being placed, a few seconds'
warning was given, and at the word 'look' the subject
opened his eyes and looked at the objects, closing his eyes
again at the word 'close.' The time of exposure was five seconds.
This time was divided as equally as possible between the two
figures, which were simultaneously exposed, the observer glancing
freely from one to the other as in the common observation
on which our ideas of objects are founded. At the end of the
exposure the subject sat with closed eyes and reported the
several appearances and disappearances of the ideas or mental
images of the objects just presented. The conditions required
of him were that he should await passively the entry of the
rival claimants on his attention, favoring neither and inhibiting
neither; that is to say, he was to remit all volitional activity,
save so far as was necessary to restrict his attention to the general
field upon which the ideated objects might appear, and to
note what occurred on the field. The period of introspection,
which followed immediately the disappearance of such retinal
<span class="pagenum">[238]</span><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>images as remained, after the closing of the eyes to the external
objects, lasted sixty seconds. The reports, like the signals,
were given in a just audible tone. They were in such terms
as 'right&mdash;left,' 'small&mdash;large,' 'circle&mdash;star,' terms the
simplest that could be found, or such as seemed, in any given
case, most naturally or automatically associated with the object,
and therefore least likely to disturb the course of the observation.
And each report was noted down by the experimenter
at the instant it was given, with the time of each phase, in
seconds, as indicated by a stop-watch under the experimenter's
eye.</p>

<p>It will be remarked that the attitude required of the observer
was one which is not commonly taken. And it may be objected
that the results of an attitude so unusual towards objects so
ghostly and attenuated must be too delicate, or too complex, or
influenced by too many alien suggestions, to be plumply set
down in arabic numerals. The subjects, in fact, did at first find
the attitude not easy to assume. A visual object may hold the
attention by controlling the reflexes of the eye. But an ideational
object has ordinarily no sure command of the conscious
field save under the influence of a volitional idea or some strongly
toned affectional state. But with a little practice the difficulty
seemed to disappear. The subject became surer of his material,
and the mental object gradually acquired the same sort of individuality
as the visual object, though the impression it made
might be less intense.</p>

<p>After a few preliminary experiments, figures were devised
for the purpose of testing the effect of mere difference in the
complexity of outline. That is to say, the members of every
pair of objects were of the same uniform color-tone (Bradley's
neutral gray No. 2), presented the same extent of surface (approximately
42 sq. cm.), were exposed simultaneously for the
same length of time (5 seconds), and were in contour usually of
like general character save that the bounding line in the one was
more interrupted and complex than in the other.</p>

<p>In another series the variant was the extent of surface exposed,
the color-tone (neutral gray), outline, and other conditions
being the same for both members of each pair. The
<span class="pagenum">[239]</span><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a>smaller figures were of the same area as those of the preceding
series; in the larger figures this area was doubled. Only one
member of each pair is represented in the diagrams of this and
the next series.</p>

<p>In a third series brightness was the variant, one member
of each pair being white and the other gray (Bradley's cool
gray No. 2). All other conditions were for both figures the
same.</p>

<p>In still another series strips of granite-gray cardboard half a
centimeter wide were cut out and pasted on black cards, some
in straight and some in broken lines, but all of the same total
length (10 cm.). These were exposed under the same general
conditions as those which have already been described, and
were intended to show the relative effects of the two sorts of
lines.</p>

<p><i>Series No. 1.</i>&mdash;For the purpose of obtaining something that
might serve as a standard of comparison, a series of observations
was made in which the members of every pair were
exact duplicates of each other, and were presented under
exactly the same conditions, spatial position of course excepted.
The records of these observations are for convenience
placed first as Table I.</p>

<p>In treating the facts recorded in the accompanying tables
as phenomena of inhibition no assumption is implied, it may
be well to repeat, that the ideational images are forces struggling
with each other for mastery. Nor is it implied, on the
other hand, that they are wholly unconditioned facts, unrelated
to any phenomena in which we are accustomed to see
the expression of energy. Inhibition is meaningless save as an
implication of power lodged somewhere. The implication is
that these changes are conditioned and systematic, and that
among the conditions of our ideas, if not among the ideas themselves,
power is exerted and an inferior yields to a superior
force. Such force, in accordance with our general presupposition,
must be neural or cerebral. Even mental inhibition, therefore,
must ultimately refer to the physical conditions of the
psychical fact. But the reference, to have any scientific value,
must be made as definite as the case will allow. We must at
least show what are the conditions under which a state of consciousness
which might otherwise occur does not occur. When
such conditions are pointed out, and then only, we have a case
of what has been called psychical inhibition; and we are justified
in calling it inhibition because these are precisely the conditions
under which physiological inhibition may properly be inferred.
And, we may add, in order that the conditions may be
intelligibly stated and compared they must be referable to some
<span class="pagenum">[241]</span><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>objective, cognizable fact. Here the accessible facts, the experiential
data, to which the psychical changes observed and
the cerebral changes assumed may both be referred, are visual
objects, namely, the figures already described.</p>

<p>What may occur when these objects are precisely alike, and
are seen under conditions in all respects alike except as to spatial
position, is indicated in Table I. The general average shows that
the image referred to the left-hand object was seen some 30 seconds
per minute; that referred to the right-hand image, some 31
seconds. Sometimes neither image was present, sometimes both
were reported present together, and the time when both were
reported present is included in the account. In this series it appears,
on the whole, that each image has about the same chance
in the ideational rivalry, with a slight preponderance in favor of
the right. Individual variations, which may be seen at a glance
by inspection of the averages, show an occasional preponderance
in favor of the left. But the tendency is, in most cases, towards
what we may call right-handed ideation.</p>

<p><i>Series No. II.</i>&mdash;In the second series (Table II.) we find that,
other things being equal, <i>an increase in the relative complexity
of the outline favors the return of the image to consciousness</i>.
Including the time when both images were reported present at
once, the simpler appears but 27 seconds per minute as against
34 seconds for the more complex. No attempt was made to
arrange the figures on any regularly increasing scale of complexity
so as to reach quantitative results. The experiment was
tentative merely.<span class="pagenum">[242]</span><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a></p>

<p>In this and the following tables the numbers in the body of the columns represent, in each case, the combined result of two

<p><span class="pagenum">[243]</span><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>Can anything be said, based on the reports, by way of explanation
of the advantage which complexity gives? In the
first place, the attitude of the subject towards his image seems
to have been much the same as his attitude towards an external
object: to his observation the image became, in fact, an object.
&quot;When the image was gone,&quot; says one, &quot;my eyes seemed to
be in search of something.&quot; And occasionally the one ideated
object was felt to exert an influence over the other. &quot;The
complex seemed to affect the form of the simpler figure.&quot; &quot;It
seemed that the complex actually had the effect of diminishing
the size of the simpler figure.&quot; From time to time the images
varied, too, in distinctness, just as the objects of perception
vary, and the superior distinctness of the more complex was
frequently noted by the subjects. Now the importance of the
boundary line in perception is well understood. It seems to
have a corresponding importance here. &quot;What I notice more
in the simple figure,&quot; says one observer, &quot;is the mass; in the
complex, the outline.&quot; &quot;The simple seemed to lose its form,&quot;
says another, &quot;the complex did not; the jagged edge was very
distinct.&quot; And it is not improbable, in view of the reports, that
irregularities involving change of direction and increase in extent
of outline contributed mainly to the greater persistence of
the more complicated image, the 'mass' being in both figures
approximately the same. Nor did the advantage of the broken
line escape the notice of the subject. &quot;I found myself,&quot; is the
comment of one, &quot;following the contour of the star&mdash;exploring.
The circle I could go around in a twinkle.&quot; Again, &quot;the
<span class="pagenum">[244]</span><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>points entered the field before the rest of the figure.&quot; And
again, &quot;the angle is the last to fade away.&quot;</p>

<p>Now this mental exploration involves, of course, changes in
the direction of the attention corresponding in some way to
changes in the direction of the lines. Does this shifting of the
attention involve ideated movements? There can be little doubt
that it does. &quot;I felt an impulse,&quot; says one, &quot;to turn in the
direction of the image seen.&quot; And the unconscious actual
movements, particularly those of the eyes, which are associated
with ideated movements, took place so often that it is hard to
believe they were ever wholly excluded. Such movements,
being slight and automatically executed, were not at first noticed.
The subjects were directed, in fact, to attend in all cases
primarily to the appearance and disappearance of the images,
and it was only after repeated observations and questions were
put, that they became aware of associated movements, and were
able, at the close of an observation, to describe them. After
that, it became a common report that the eyes followed the attention.
And as we must assume some central influence as the
cause of this movement, which while the eyes were closed could
have no reflex relation to the stimulus of light, we must impute
it to the character of the ideas, or to their physical substrates.</p>

<p>The idea, or, as we may call it, in view of the attitude of
the subject, the internal sensory impression, thus seems to bear
a double aspect. It is, in the cases noted, at once sensory and
motor, or at any rate involves motor elements. And the effect
of the activity of such motor elements is both to increase the
distinctness of the image and to prolong the duration of the
process by which it is apprehended. The sensory process thus
stands in intimate dependence on the motor. Nor would
failure to move the eyes or any other organ with the movement
of attention, if established, be conclusive as against the presence
of motor elements. A motor impulse or idea does not always
result in apparent peripheral movement. In the suppressed
speech, which is the common language of thought, the possibility
of incipient or incomplete motor innervations is well recognized.
But where the peripheral movement actually occurs it
must be accounted for. And as the cause here must be central,
<span class="pagenum">[245]</span><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>it seems reasonable to impute it to certain motor innervations
which condition the shifting of the mental attitude and may be
incipient merely, but which, if completed, result in the shifting
of the eyes and the changes of bodily attitude which accompany
the scrutiny of an external object. And the sensory process is,
to some extent at least, conditioned by the motor, if, indeed,
the two are anything more than different aspects of one and the
same process.<a name="FNanchor_7_81" id="FNanchor_7_81"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_7_81'>7</a></p>

<p>But where, now, the subject is occupied in mentally tracing
the boundaries of one of his two images he must inhibit all motor
innervations incompatible with the innervations which condition
such tracing: the rival process must cease, and the rival image
will fade. He may, it is true, include both images in the same
mental sweep. The boundary line is not the only possible line
of movement. In fact, we may regard this more comprehensive
glance as equivalent to an enlargement of the boundaries so as
to include different mental objects, instead of different parts of
but one. Or, since the delimitation of our 'objects' varies
with our attitude or aim, we may call it an enlargement of the
object. But in any case the mental tracing of a particular
boundary or particular spatial dimensions seems to condition the
sense of the corresponding content, and through inhibition of
inconsistent movements to inhibit the sense of a different content.
No measure of the span of consciousness can, of course, be
found in these reports. The movements of the attention are
subtle and swift, and there was nothing in the form of the experiments
to determine at any precise instant its actual scope.
All we need assume, therefore, when the images are said to be
seen together, is that neither has, for the time being, any advantage
over the other in drawing attention to itself. If in the complete
observation, however, any such advantage appears, we
may treat it as a case of inhibition. By definition, an idea
which assumes a place in consciousness which but for itself, as
experiment indicates, another might occupy, inhibits the other.<span class="pagenum">[246]</span><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[247]</span><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a><i>Series No. III.</i>&mdash;In the third series, where the variant is the
extent of (gray) surface exposed, the preponderance is in favor
of the image corresponding to the larger object. This shows an
appearance of some 33 seconds per minute as against 24 for the
smaller (Table III.). Here the most obvious thing in the reports,
aside from the relative durations, is the greater vividness of the
favored image. Something, no doubt, is due to the greater
length of boundary line and other spatial dimensions involved
in the greater size. And it is this superiority, and the ampler
movements which it implies, which were probably felt by the
subject who reports 'a feeling of expansion in the eye which
corresponds to the larger image and of contraction in the other.'
But the more general comment is as to the greater vividness of
the larger image. &quot;The larger images seem brighter whichever
side they are on.&quot; &quot;The larger is a little more distinct,
as if it were nearer to me.&quot; &quot;Large much more vivid than
small.&quot; Such are the reports which run through the series.
And they point, undoubtedly, to a cumulative effect, corresponding
to a well-known effect in sensation, in virtue of which
greater extension may become the equivalent of greater intensity.
In other words, the larger image made the stronger impression.
Now in external perception the stronger impression tends to
hold the attention more securely; that is, it is more effective in
producing those adjustments of the sensory organs which perceptive
attention implies. So here what was noticed as the
superior brightness and distinctness of the larger image may
be supposed to imply some advantage in the latter in securing
those adjustments of the mental attitude which were favorable to
the apprehension of that image. Advantage means here,
again, in part at least, if the considerations we have urged are
sound, inhibition of those motor processes which would tend to
turn attention to a rival. And here, again, the adjustment may
reach no external organ. An incipient innervation, which is
all that we need assume as the condition of a change of mental
attitude, would suffice to block, or at least to hamper, inconsistent
innervations no more complete than itself.<span class="pagenum">[248]</span><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[249]</span><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a><i>Series No. IV.</i>&mdash;This and the next following series do
not suggest much that differs in principle from what has been
stated already. It should be noted, however, that in the white-gray
series (Table IV.) the persistence of the gray in ideation
surprised the subjects themselves, who confessed to an expectation
that the white would assert itself as affectively in ideation
as in perception. But it is not improbable that affective or
&aelig;sthetic elements contributed to the result, which shows as
high a figure as 25 seconds for the gray as against 29 for the
white. One subject indeed (IV.) found the gray restful, and
gives accordingly an individual average of 32 for the gray as
against 27 for the white. More than one subject, in fact, records
a slight advantage in favor of the gray. And if we must
admit the possibility of a subjective interest, it seems not unlikely
that a bald blank space, constituting one extreme of the white-black
series, should be poorer in suggestion and perhaps more
fatiguing than intermediate members lying nearer to the general
tone of the ordinary visual field. Probably the true function
of the brightness quality in favoring ideation would be better
shown by a comparison of different grays. The general
average shows, it is true, a decided preponderance in favor of
the white, but the individual variations prove it would be unsafe
to conclude directly, without experimental test, from the laws of
perception to the laws of ideation.</p>

<p><i>Series No. V.</i>&mdash;The fifth series, which was suggested by
the second, presents the problem of the lines in greater simplicity
than the second; and, unlike the earlier series, it shows in
all the individual averages the same sort of preponderance as is
<span class="pagenum">[250]</span><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>shown in the general average (straight line, 31; broken line,
38). The footings of the columns, moreover, show an aggregate
in favor of the broken line in the case of every pair of lines
that were exposed together. The results in this case may therefore
be regarded as cleaner and more satisfactory than those
reached before, and come nearer, one may say, to the expression
of a general law. The theoretical interpretation, however,
would be in both cases the same.</p>

<p><i>Series No. VI.</i>&mdash;Both the figures in each pair of this series
were of the same material (granite-gray cardboard) and of the
same area and outline, but the content of one of the two was
varied with dark lines for the most part concentric with the<span class="pagenum">[252]</span><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>
periphery.</p>

<p>The advantage on the side of the figures with a varied content
is marked, the general averages showing a greater difference
than is shown in any of the tables so far considered. And
the advantage appears on the same side both in the individual
averages and in the averages for the different pairs as shown at
the foot of the columns. There can be little doubt, accordingly,
that we have here the expression of a general law.</p>

<p>For the meaning of this law we may consult the notes of
the subjects: 'The plain figure became a mere amorphous
mass;' 'the inner lines reinforce the shape, for while previously
the number of points in this star has increased (in ideation),
here the number is fixed, and fixed correctly;' 'my
attention traversed the lines of the content, and seemed to be
held by them;' 'the variety of the marked objects was felt as
more interesting;' 'the attention was more active when considering
the marked figures, passing from point to point of the
figure;' 'the surface of the plain figure was attended to as a
whole or mass, without conscious activity;' 'in the plain figure
I thought of the gray, in the marked figure I thought of the
lines;' 'part of the plain figure tended to have lines.'</p>

<p>The part played by the motor elements previously referred
to in sustaining attention and prolonging (internal) sensation is
here unmistakable. We have further evidence, too, of the
value of the line in defining and strengthening the mental attitude.
In a mass of homogeneous elements such as is presented
by a uniform gray surface, the attention is equally engaged by
all and definitely held by none. Monotony therefore means
dullness. And the inhibition of incompatible attitudes being as
weak and uncertain as the attitudes actually but loosely assumed,
the latter are readily displaced, and the sensation to which they
correspond as readily disappears. Hence the greater interest
excited by the lined figures. The lines give definiteness and
direction to the attention, and as definitely inhibit incompatible
attitudes. And the shutting out of the latter by the spontaneous
activity of the mind means that it is absorbed or interested in
its present occupation.<span class="pagenum">[253]</span><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a></p>

<p>General average: (5), 27.75 sec.;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (10), 29.15 sec.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[254]</span><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a><i>Series No. VII.</i>&mdash;The object of this series was to determine
the effect in ideation of exposing for unequal lengths of time
the two objects compared. The figures compared were of the
same area and outline, and were distinguished only by their
color, one being red and the other green. These colors were
employed, after a preliminary test, as showing, on the whole,
to nearly equal advantage in the individual choice of colors.
The shorter exposure was five seconds and the longer exposure
ten seconds. The color that was to be seen the longer time
was exposed first alone; after five seconds the other was exposed;
and then both were seen for five seconds together, so
that neither might have the advantage of the more recent impression.
The two colors were regularly alternated, and in
one half of the series the longer exposure was to the right, in
the other half to the left. The extra five seconds were thus in
each case at the beginning of the experiment.</p>

<p>The general averages show only a slight advantage in favor
of the color which was exposed the longer time, namely, 29.15
seconds, as against 27.75 seconds. It is not easy to believe that
the advantage of sole occupancy of the visual field for five seconds,
without any offsetting disadvantage in the next five seconds,
should have so slight an effect on the course of ideation. And
it is not improbable that there was an offsetting disadvantage.
In the presence of color the subject can scarcely remain in the
attitude of quiet curiosity which it is easy to maintain in the
observation of colorless objects. A positive interest is excited.
And the appearance of a new color in the field when there is
another color there already seems to be capable of exciting, by
a sort of successive contrast different from that ordinarily described,
an interest which is the stronger from the fact that the
subject has already been interested in a different color. That
is to say, the transition from color to color (only red and green
were employed) seems to be more impressive than the transition
from black to color. And, under the conditions of the experiment,
the advantage of this more impressive transition lay
always with the color which was exposed the shorter time.</p>

<p>Judging from the introspective notes, the outline seems to
suffer, in competition with a colored content, some loss of power
<span class="pagenum">[255]</span><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>to carry the attention and maintain its place in the ideation.
&quot;The colors tend to diffuse themselves, ignoring the boundary,&quot;
says one. &quot;The images fade from the periphery toward the
center,&quot; says another. On the other hand, one of the subjects
finds that when both images are present the color tends to fade
out. This may perhaps be explained by the remark of another
subject to the effect that there is an alternate shifting of the
attention when both images are present. An attitude of continued
and definite change, we may suppose, is one in which
the color interest must yield to the interest in boundaries and
definite spatial relations.</p>

<p>Other interesting facts come out in the notes. One subject
finds the ideated plane farther away than the objective plane;
another conceives the two as coinciding. The movement of the
eyes is by this time distinctly perceived by the subject. The
reports run as follows: 'Eye-movements seem to follow the
changes in ideation;' 'I find my eyes already directed, when
an image is ideated, to the corresponding side, and am sometimes
conscious of the movement, but the movement is not intended
or willed;' 'in ideating any particular color I find my
attention almost always directed to the side on which the corresponding
object was seen.' This last observation seems to be
true for the experience of every subject, and, generally speaking,
the images occupy the same relative positions as the objects:
the image of the right object is seen to the right, that of the left
object to the left, and the space between the two remains tolerably
constant, especially for the full-faced figures.</p>

<p>This fact suggested a means of eliminating the disturbing
influence of color, and its contrasts and surprises, by the substitution
of gray figures identical in form and size and distinguished
only by their spatial position. The result appears in
the table which follows (VIII.).</p>

<p><i>Series No. VIII.</i>&mdash;The object of this experiment was the
same as that of No. VII. Granite-gray figures, however, were
substituted, for the reasons already assigned, in place of the
red and green figures. And here the effect of additional time
in the exposure is distinctly marked, the general averages showing
32.12 seconds for the image of the object which was exposed
10 seconds, as against 25.42 seconds for the other.<span class="pagenum">[256]</span><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a></p>

<p>The interpretation of this difference may be made in accordance
with the principles already laid down. The ideated and
actual movements which favor the recurrence and persistence
of an idea are, on grounds generally recognized in psychology,
much more likely to occur and repeat themselves when the corresponding
movements, or the same movements in completer
form, have frequently been repeated in observation of the corresponding
object.</p>

executed&mdash;was recognized as such by one of the subjects, who
says: &quot;When the two objects are before me I am conscious of
what seem to be images of movement, or ideated movements,
not actual movements.&quot; The same subject also finds the image
of the object which had the longer exposure not only more
vivid in the quality of the content, but more distinct in outline.</p>

<p><i>Series No. IX.</i>&mdash;In this experiment the objects, which were
of granite-gray cardboard, were exactly alike, but were exposed
at different times and places. After the first had been exposed
five seconds alone, it was covered by means of a sliding screen,
and the second was then exposed for the same length of time,
the interval between the two exposures being also five seconds.
Two observations were made with each pair, the first exposure
being in one case to the left and in the other case to the right.
The object here was, of course, to determine what, if any, advantage
the more recent of the two locally different impressions
would have in the course of ideation. The table shows that the
image of the object last seen had so far the advantage in the ideational
rivalry that it remained in consciousness, on the average,
almost three times as long as the other, the average being, for
the first, 12.64 seconds; for the second, 36.45 seconds. And
both the individual averages and the averages for the several pairs
show, without exception, the same general tendency.</p>

<p>The notes show, further, that the image of the figure first
seen was not only less persistent but relatively less vivid than
the other, though the latter was not invariably the case. One
subject had 'an impression that the images were farther apart'
than in the series where the exposure of the two objects was
simultaneous, though the distance between the objects was
in all cases the same, the time difference being, apparently,
translated into spatial terms and added to the spatial difference.
The sort of antagonism which temporal distinctions tend, under
<span class="pagenum">[258]</span><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>certain conditions, to set up between ideas is illustrated by
the remark of another subject, who reports that 'the attention
was fairly dragged by the respective images.' And the fact of
such antagonism, or incompatibility, is confirmed by the extremely
low figure which represents the average time when both
images were reported present at the same time. The two
images, separated by processes which the time interval implies,
seem to be more entirely incompatible and mutually inhibitory
than the images of objects simultaneously perceived. For not
only does the advantage of a few seconds give the fresher image
a considerable preponderance in its claim on the attention,
but even the earlier image, after it has once caught the attention,
usually succeeds in shutting out the other from a simultaneous
view.</p>

<p><i>Series No. X.</i>&mdash;The objects used in this experiment were
straight lines, two strips of granite-gray cardboard, each ten
centimeters long and half a centimeter wide, the one being vertical
and the other horizontal. These were pasted on black
cards and exposed in alternate positions, each appearing once
to the right and once to the left. The figures in the columns
represent in each case the combined result of two such observations.</p>

<p>The experiments with these lines were continued at intervals
<span class="pagenum">[259]</span><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>through a number of weeks, each individual average representing
the result of ten observations, or of five pairs of exposures
with alternating objects.</p>

<p>The striking feature in the observations is the uniformity of
the results as they appear in the general averages and in the
averages for each pair as shown at the foot of the columns.
There is some variation in the individual tendencies, as shown
by the individual averages. But the general average for this
group of subjects shows a difference of less than half a second
per minute, and that difference is in favor of the vertical line.</p>

<p>This series will serve a double purpose. It shows, in the
first place, that on the whole the vertical and the horizontal lines
have a nearly equal chance of recurrence in image or idea. It
will serve, in the second place, as a standard of comparison
when we come to consider the effect of variations in the position
and direction of lines.</p>

<p><i>Series No. XI.</i>&mdash;In this series full-faced figures were compared
with outline figures of the same dimensions and form.
Material, granite-gray cardboard. The area of the full-faced
figures was the same as that of the figures of similar character
employed in the various series, approximately 42 sq. cm.; the
breadth of the lines in the outline figures was half a centimeter.
The objects in each pair were exposed simultaneously, with the
<span class="pagenum">[260]</span><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a>usual instructions to the subject, namely, to regard each object
directly, and to give to each the same share of attention as to
the other.</p>

<p>The form of the experiment was suggested by the results of
earlier experiments with lines. It will be remembered that the
express testimony of the subjects, confirmed by fair inference
from the tabulated record, was to the effect that lines show, in
ideation as in perception, both greater energy and clearer definition
than surfaces. By lines are meant, of course, not mathematical
lines, but narrow surfaces whose longer boundaries are
closely parallel. To bring the superior suggestiveness of the
line to a direct test was the object of this series. And the
table fully substantiates the former conclusion. For the outline
figure we have a general average of 41.08 seconds per
minute, as against 28.10 seconds for the full-faced figure.</p>

<p>The notes here may be quoted as corroborative of previous
statements. &quot;I notice,&quot; says one, &quot;a tendency of the color in
the full-faced figure to spread over the background&quot;&mdash;a remark
which bears out what has been said of the relative vagueness of
the subjective processes excited by a broad homogeneous surface.
To this may be added: &quot;The full-faced figures became
finally less distinct than the linear, and faded from the outside
in;&quot; &quot;the areal (full-faced) figure gradually faded away,
while the linear remained.&quot; Another comment runs: &quot;I feel
the left (full-faced) striving to come into consciousness, but
failing to arrive. Don't see it; feel it; and yet the feeling is
connected with the eyes.&quot; This comment, made, of course,
after the close of an observation, may serve as evidence of
processes subsidiary to ideation, and may be compared, in respect
of the motor factors which the 'striving' implies, with
the preparatory stage which Binet found to be an inseparable
and essential part of any given (vocal) motor reaction.<a name="FNanchor_8_82" id="FNanchor_8_82"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_8_82'>8</a></p>

<p><i>Series No. XII.</i>&mdash;Both the figures of each pair in this series
were linear, and presented the same extent of surface (granite-gray)
with the same length of line. In other words, both figures
were constituted of the same elements, and in both the corresponding
lines ran in the same direction; but the lines in the
one were connected so as to form a figure with a continuous
boundary, while the lines of the other were disconnected, <i>i.e.</i>,
did not inclose a space. The total length of line in each object
was twenty centimeters, the breadth of the lines five millimeters.
Both figures were arranged symmetrically with respect to a perpendicular axis.<span class="pagenum">[261]</span><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a></p>

<p>The experiment was devised in further exploration of the
effect of the line in ideation. The result fully bears out, when
read in the light of the introspective notes, what has been said
of the importance of the motor element in ideation. It might
have been supposed, in view of the importance usually attached
to unity or wholeness of impression in arresting and holding the
attention in external perception, that the completed figure would
have the more persistent image. The general averages, however,
stand as follows: Interrupted lines, 39.32 seconds per
minute; completed figure, 29.26 seconds per minute. The individual
averages show slight variations from the tendency expressed
in these figures, but the averages for the several pairs
are all in harmony with the general averages.</p>

<p>The notes furnish the key to the situation: &quot;I felt that I
was doing more, and had more to do, when thinking of the
broken lines.&quot; &quot;The broken figure seemed more difficult to
get, but to attract attention; continuous figure easy to grasp.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<span class="pagenum">[263]</span><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>Felt more active when contemplating the image of the broken
figure.&quot; &quot;In the broken figure I had a feeling of jumping from
line to line, and each line seemed to be a separate figure; eye-movement
very perceptible.&quot; The dominance of the interrupted
lines in ideation is evidently connected with the more varied and
energetic activity which they excited in the contemplating mind.
Apparently the attention cannot be held unless (paradoxical as
it may sound) it is kept moving about its object. Hence, a certain
degree of complexity in an object is necessary to sustain our
interest in it, if we exclude, as we must of course in these experiments,
extraneous grounds of interest. Doubtless there are
limits to the degree of complexity which we find interesting and
which compels attention. A mere confused or disorderly complex,
wanting altogether in unity, could hardly be expected to
secure attention, if there is any truth in the principle, already
recognized, that the definite has in ideation a distinct advantage
over the vague. Here again the notes suggest the method of
interpretation. &quot;The broken lines,&quot; says one, &quot;tended to come
together, and to take the form of the continuous figure.&quot; Another
remarks: &quot;The broken figure suggests a whole connected
figure; the continuous is complete, the broken wants to be.&quot;
In virtue of their power to excite and direct the activity of the
attention the interrupted lines seem to have been able to suggest
the unity which is wanting in them as they stand. &quot;The
broken lines,&quot; says another, &quot;seemed to run out and unite, and
then to separate again&quot;&mdash;a remark which shows a state of brisk
and highly suggestive activity in the processes implied in attention
to these lines. And a glance at the diagram will show how
readily the union of the broken lines may be made. These
were arranged symmetrically because the lines of the completed
figures were so arranged, in order to equalize as far as possible
whatever &aelig;sthetic advantage a symmetrical arrangement might
be supposed to secure.</p>

<p>It thus appears that, whatever the effect in ideation of unity
in the impression, the effect is much greater when we have
complexity in unity. The advantage of unity is undoubtedly
the advantage which goes with definiteness of impression, which
implies definite excitations and inhibitions, and that concentration
<span class="pagenum">[264]</span><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a>of energy and intensity of effect in which undirected activity
is wanting. But a bare unity, it appears, is less effective than
a diversified unity. To what extent this diversity may be carried
we make no attempt to determine; but, within the limits of
our experiment, its value in the ideational rivalry seems to be
indisputable. And the results of the experiment afford fresh
proof of the importance of the motor element in internal perception.</p>

<p>General average: Figure, 34.03 sec.; vertical lines, 36.40 sec.</p></div>


<p><i>Series No. XIII.</i>&mdash;In this series, also, both the figures of
each pair were constituted of the same elements; that is to say,
both were linear, and presented the same extent of surface
(granite-gray), with the same length of line, the total length of
the lines in each figure being twenty centimeters and the breadth
of the lines being three millimeters. But while the lines of one
figure were connected so as to form a continuous boundary, the
lines of the other figure were all vertical, with equal interspaces.
And, as in the last preceding series, the two figures were formed
by a different but symmetrical arrangement of the same lines.</p>

<p>As before, the advantage is on the side of the disconnected
lines. In this case, however, it is very slight, the general
averages showing 34.03 seconds for the completed figure, as
against 36.40 seconds for the lines. This reduction in the difference
of the averages is probably to be explained by the reduced
<span class="pagenum">[265]</span><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>complexity in the arrangement of the lines. So far as
they are all parallel they would not be likely to give rise to
great diversity of movement, though one subject does, indeed,
speak of traversing them in all directions. In fact, the completed
figures show greater diversity of direction than the lines,
and in this respect might be supposed to have the advantage of
the lines. The notes suggest a reason why the lines should
still prove the more persistent in ideation. &quot;The lines appealed
to me as a group; I tended always to throw a boundary around
the lines,&quot; is the comment of one of the subjects. From this
point of view the lines would form a figure with a content, and
we have learned (see Series No. VI.) that a space with a varied
content is more effective in ideation than a homogeneous space
of the same extent and general character. And this unity of
the lines as a group was felt even where no complete boundary
line was distinctly suggested. &quot;I did not throw a boundary
around the lines,&quot; says another subject, &quot;but they had a kind
of unity.&quot; It is possible also that from the character of their
arrangement the lines reinforced each other by a kind of visual
rhythm, a view which is supported by the comments: 'The
lines were a little plainer than the figure;' 'figure shadowy,
lives vivid;' 'the figure grew dimmer towards the end, the
lines retained their vividness.'</p>

<p>On the whole, however, the chances are very nearly equal
in the two cases for the recurrence of the image, and a comparison
of this series with Series No. XII. cannot leave much
doubt that the greater effectiveness of the lines in the latter is
due to their greater complexity. In view, therefore, of the fact
that in both series the objects are all linear, and that the two
series differ in no material respect but in the arrangement of
the disconnected lines, the circumstance that a reduction in the
complexity of this arrangement is attended by a very considerable
reduction in the power of the lines to recur in the image
or idea is a striking confirmation of the soundness of our previous
interpretation.</p>

<p><i>Series No. XIV.</i>&mdash;In this series full-faced figures (granite-gray)
similar in character to those made use of in former experiments,
were employed. The objects were suspended by black
silk threads, but while one of them remained stationary during
the exposure the other was lowered through a distance of six
and one half centimeters and was then drawn up again. The
object moved was first that on the right hand, then that on the
left. As the two objects in each case were exactly alike, the
comparative effect of motion and rest in the object upon the
persistence in consciousness of the corresponding image was
obtained. The result shows a distinct preponderance in favor
of the moved object, which has an average of 37.39 seconds per
minute as against 28.88 seconds for the stationary object. The
averages for the pairs, as seen at the foot of the columns, all
run the same way, and only one exception to the general tendency
appears among the individual averages.<span class="pagenum">[266]</span><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a></p>

<p>The effectiveness of a bright light or of a moving object in
arresting attention in external perception is well understood.
And the general testimony of the subjects in this experiment
shows that it required some effort, during the exposure, to give
an equal share of attention to the moving and the resting object.
Table IV., however, which contains the record of the observations
in the white-gray series, shows that we cannot carry over,
unmodified, into the field of ideation all the laws that obtain in
the field of perception. The result of the experiment, accordingly,
could not be predicted with certainty. But the course of
<span class="pagenum">[267]</span><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>ideation, in this case, seems to follow the same general tendency
as the course of perception: the resting object labors under a
great disadvantage. And if there is any force in the claim that
diversity and complexity in an object, with the relatively greater
subjective activity which they imply, tend to hold the attention
to the ideated object about which this activity is employed, the
result could hardly be other than it is. There can be no question
of the presence of a strong motor element where the object
attended to moves, and where the movement is imaged no less
than the qualities of the object. In fact, the object and its
movement were sometimes sharply distinguished. According
to one subject, 'the image was rather the image of the motion
than of the object moving.' Again: 'The introspection was disturbed
by the idea of motion; I did not get a clear image of the
moving object; imaged the motion rather than the object.'
And a subject, who on one occasion vainly searched the ideational
field for sixty seconds to find an object, reports: 'I had
a feeling of something going up and down, but no object.'
Clearly an important addition was made to the active processes
implied in the ideation of a resting object, and it would be singular
if this added activity carried with it no corresponding advantage
in the ideational rivalry. In one case the ideas of rest
and of movement were curiously associated in the same introspective
act. &quot;The figure which moved,&quot; says the subject, &quot;was
imaged as stationary, and yet the idea of movement was distinctly
present.&quot;</p>

<p>The reports as to the vividness of the rival images are somewhat
conflicting. Sometimes it is the moving object which was
imaged with the more vivid content, and sometimes the resting
object. One report runs: &quot;The moving object had less color,
but was more distinct in outline than the stationary.&quot; Sometimes
one of the positions of the moving object was alone represented
in the image, either the initial position (on a level with
the resting object) or a position lower down. On the other
hand, we read: &quot;The image of the moved object seemed at
times a general image that reached clear down, sometimes like
a series of figures, and not very distinct; but sometimes the
series had very distinct outlines.&quot; In one case (the circle) the
<span class="pagenum">[268]</span><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>image of the figure in its upper position remained, while the
serial repetitions referred to extended below. This, as might
be supposed, is the report of an exceptionally strong visualizer.
In other cases the object and its movements were not dissociated:
&quot;The moved object was imaged as moving, and color
and outline were retained.&quot; And again: &quot;Twice through the
series I could see the image of the moving object as it moved.&quot;
&quot;Image of moved object moved all the time.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Series No. XV.</i>&mdash;The figures in each pair of this series
were full-faced, and of the same shape and size, but one was
gray and the other colored, the gray being seen first to the left,
and then to the right. The colors used were of Prang's series
(Gray, R., Y., G., B., V.). In No. 1 the figures were in the form
of a six-pointed star, and gray was compared with red. In No.
2 the figures were elliptical, and gray was compared with yellow.
In No. 3 a broad circular band of gray was compared with the
same figure in green. In No. 4 the figures were kite-shaped,
and gray was compared with blue. In No. 5 a circular surface
of gray was compared with a circular surface of violet. The
objects compared were exposed at the same time, under the
usual conditions.</p>

<p>As might perhaps be expected, the colored surfaces proved
to be the more persistent in ideation, showing a general average
of 37.81 seconds per minute as against 30.90 seconds for the
gray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[269]</span><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a>The distinctness of the process of color apprehension is reflected
in the notes: &quot;In the colored images I find the color
rather than the form occupying my attention; the image seems
like an area of color, as though I were close to a wall and could
not see the boundary;&quot; and then we have the significant addition,
&quot;yet I feel myself going about in the colored area.&quot;
Again: &quot;In the gray the outline was more distinct than in the
colors; the color seems to come up as a shade, and the outline
does not come with it.&quot; Or again: &quot;The gray has a more
sharply defined outline than the color.&quot; This superior definiteness
in outline of the gray figures is subject to exceptions, and
one subject reports 'the green outline more distinct than the
gray.' And even so brilliant a color as yellow did not always
obscure the boundary: &quot;The yellow seems to burn into my
head,&quot; says one of the subjects, &quot;but the outline was distinct.&quot;
The reports in regard to this color (yellow) are in fact rather
striking, and are sometimes given in terms of energy, as though
the subject were distinctly conscious of an active process (objectified)
set up in the apprehension of this color. The reports run:
&quot;The yellow has an expansive power; there seemed to be no
definite outline.&quot; &quot;The yellow seemed to exert a power over
the gray to suppress it; its power was very strong; it seemed
to be aggressive.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Series No. XVI.</i>&mdash;The course of experimentation having
shown the superior energy of lines, in comparison with surfaces,
in stimulating, directing, and holding the attention, a series of
<span class="pagenum">[270]</span><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a>figures was devised to test the question whether the direction of
the lines would have any effect upon the length of time during
which <i>both</i> images of a pair of linear figures would be presented
together. The materials used were granite-gray strips half a
centimeter wide. The letters (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) at the heads of the
columns refer to the same letters in the diagram, and distinguish
the different arrangements of the same pair of objects. The figures
in the body of the columns show only the length of time
during which both images were reported present in consciousness
together. At the foot of the columns are shown the
averages for each pair. No general averages are shown, as
the problem presented by each pair is peculiar to itself.</p>

<p class="sccaption">Fig. 7.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[271]</span><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>The maximum is reached in No. 1<i>a</i>, where the angle has the
arrowhead form and each angle points to the other. It should
be remarked that the diagram is somewhat misleading in respect
to the distance of the figures, which in this as in the other experiments
was 25 cm. The figures therefore were far enough
away from each other to be perceived and imaged in individual
distinctness. But the 'energy' of the lines, especially where
the lines united to form an acute angle, was often sufficient to
overcome the effect of this separation, and either to bring the
figures nearer together or to unite them into a single object.
The notes are very decisive in this regard. A few of them
may be cited: &quot;The angles tended to join points.&quot; &quot;The
figures showed a tendency to move in the direction of the apex.&quot;
&quot;The angles (2<i>a</i>) united to form a cross.&quot; &quot;When both figures
(4<i>b</i>) were in mind I felt disagreeable strains in the eyeballs;
one figure led me to the right and the other to the left.&quot; The
effect of the last-named figures (4<i>a</i>) seemed to be different from
that of 1<i>a</i> and 2<i>a</i>, though the apex of each angle was turned to
that of the other in each of the three cases. &quot;The two angles,&quot;
says another subject, speaking of 4<i>a</i>, &quot;appeared antagonistic
to each other.&quot; It will be observed that they are less acute than
the other angles referred to, and the confluent lines of each
figure are far less distinctly directed towards the corresponding
lines of the opposing figure, so that the attention, so far as it is
determined in direction by the lines, would be less likely to be
carried over from the one image to the other.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when the angles were turned away from
each other the legs of the angles in the two figures compared
were brought into closer relation, so that in 2<i>b</i>, for instance, the
average is even higher than in 2<i>a</i>. Similarly the average in
3<i>b</i>, an obtuse angle, is higher than in 3<i>a</i>. The notes show
that in such cases the contrasted angles tended to close up and
<span class="pagenum">[272]</span><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a>coalesce into a single figure with a continuous boundary.
&quot;The ends (2<i>b</i>) came together and formed a diamond.&quot;
&quot;When the angles were turned away from each other the lines
had an occasional tendency to close up.&quot; &quot;There was a tendency
to unite the two images (4<i>a</i>) into a triangle.&quot; &quot;The two
figures seemed to tug each other, and the images were in fact
a little closer than the objects (4<i>a</i>).&quot; &quot;The images (4<i>a</i>) formed
a triangle.&quot; So with regard to the figures in 5<i>a</i>. &quot;When
both were in the field there seemed to be a pulling of the left
over to the right, though no apparent displacement.&quot; &quot;The
two figures formed a square.&quot;</p>

<p>The lowest average&mdash;and it is much lower than any other
average in the table&mdash;is that of 5<i>b</i>, in which the contrasted objects
have neither angles nor incomplete lines directed to any common
point between the objects. In view of the notes, the tabulated
record of these two figures (5<i>b</i>) is very significant, and strikingly
confirms, by its negative testimony, what 1<i>a</i> and 2<i>b</i> have to teach
us by their positive testimony. The averages are, in the three
cases just cited: 1<i>a</i>, 35.11 seconds; 2<i>b</i>,33.11 seconds; 5<i>b</i>, 15
seconds per minute.</p>

<p>On the whole, then, the power of the line to arrest, direct,
and keep the attention, through the greater energy and definiteness
of the processes which it excites, and thereby to increase
the chances of the recurrence and persistence of its idea in consciousness,
is confirmed by the results of this series. The
greatest directive force seems to lie in the sharply acute angle.
Two such angles, pointing one towards the other, tend very
strongly to carry the attention across the gap which separates
them. (And it should be borne in mind that the distance between
the objects exposed was 25 cm.) But the power of two
incomplete lines, similarly situated, is not greatly inferior.</p>

<p>It thus appears that the attention process is in part, at least,
a motor process, which in this case follows the direction of the
lines, acquiring thereby a momentum which is not at once arrested
by a break in the line, but is readily diverted by a
change in the direction of the line. If the lines are so situated
that the attention process excited by the one set is carried away
from the other set, the one set inhibits the other. If, on the
<span class="pagenum">[273]</span><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>other hand, the lines in the one set are so situated that they
can readily take up the overrunning or unarrested processes
excited by the other set, the two figures support each other by
becoming in fact one figure. The great importance of the
motor elements of the attention process in ideation, and thus in
the persistence of the idea, is evident in either phase of the
experiment.</p>

<p>If we put these results into the form of propositions, we
find:</p>

<div class="indent"><p>1. That when the objects are similar surfaces, seen under
similar conditions, the chances of the recurrence and persistence
of their images are, on the whole, practically equal.</p>

<p>2. That surfaces bounded by complicated outlines have an
advantage in ideation, other things equal, over surfaces bounded
by simple outlines.</p>

<p>3. That as between two objects of unequal area&mdash;color,
form, and other conditions being the same&mdash;the larger object
has the advantage in the ideational rivalry.</p>

<p>4. That the image of a white object has a like advantage
over the image of a gray object.</p>

<p>5. That broken or complex lines have in ideation an advantage
over straight or simple lines.</p>

<p>6. That an object with varied content, other conditions
<span class="pagenum">[274]</span><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a>remaining the same, has an advantage over an object with
homogeneous surface.</p>

<p>7 and 8. That an increase of the time during which the
attention is given to an object increases the chances for the recurrence
of its image or idea.</p>

<p>9. That of two objects to which attention is directed in
succession, the object last seen has a distinct advantage in the
course of ideation following close on the perception of the objects.</p>

<p>10. That lines of similar appearance and equal length, one
of which is vertical and the other horizontal, have, like surfaces
of similar appearance and form and equal dimensions, practically
equal chances of recurrence and survival in ideation, the slight
difference in their chances being in favor of the vertical line.</p>

<p>11. That as between two figures of similar form and equal
dimensions, one of which has a filled homogeneous content and
the other is a mere outline figure, the latter has a marked advantage
in the course of ideation.</p>

<p>12. That of two linear and symmetrical figures, of which
one is an outline figure with continuous boundary, and the other
consists of the same linear elements, similarly disposed, as the
first, but has its lines disconnected so that it has no continuous
boundary, the latter figure has the advantage in ideation.</p>

<p>13. That if, with material similar to that described in paragraph
12, the disconnected lines are arranged so as to be vertical
and equidistant, the advantage in ideation still remains with the
disconnected lines, but is much reduced.</p>

<p>14. That if one of two figures, of similar appearance and
form and of equal dimensions, is kept in motion while it is exposed
to view, and the other is left at rest, the image of the moving
object is the more persistent.</p>

<p>15. That, under like conditions, colored objects are more
persistent in ideation than gray objects.</p>

<p>16. That lines and sharp angles, as compared with broad
surfaces, have a strong directive force in the determination of
the attention to their images or ideas; that this directive force
is strongest in the case of very acute angles, the attention being
carried forward in the direction indicated by the apex of the
angle; but that uncompleted lines, especially when two such
<span class="pagenum">[275]</span><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a>lines are directed towards each other, have a similar and not
much inferior force in the control of the course of ideation.</p></div>

<p>If we should seek now to generalize these experimental
results, they would take some such form as the following:</p>

<p>Abstraction made of all volitional aims and all &aelig;sthetic or
affective bias, the tendency of an object to recur and persist in
idea depends (within the limits imposed by the conditions of
these experiments) upon the extent of its surface, the complexity
of its form, the diversity of its contents, the length and recency
of the time during which it occupies the attention, the definiteness
of the direction which it imparts to the attention (as in the
case of angles and lines), its state of motion or of rest, and,
finally, its brightness and its color.</p>

<p>These conditions, however, are for the most part but conditions
which determine the energy, diversity, complexity and
definiteness of the active processes involved in the bestowal of
attention upon its object, and the experiments show that such
active processes are as essential in ideation as in perception.
The stability of an image, or internal sensation, thus depends
on the activity of its motor accompaniments or conditions. And
as the presence of an image to the exclusion of a rival, which
but for the effect of these motor advantages would have as strong
a claim as itself to the occupation of consciousness (cf. Series I.,
X.), may be treated as a case of inhibition, the greater
the relative persistence of an image or idea the greater we may
say is the 'force' with which it inhibits its rival. Exclusive
possession of the field involves, to the extent to which such possession
is made good, actual exclusion of the rival; and exclusion
is inhibition. Our generalization, accordingly, may take
the following form:&mdash;</p>

<p>The inhibitory effect of an idea, apart from volitional or
emotional bias, depends upon the energy, diversity, complexity
and definiteness of the motor conditions of the idea.</p>

<h2><a name="MEM3" id="MEM3"></a>CONTROL OF THE MEMORY IMAGE.</h2>

<h4>BY CHARLES S. MOORE.</h4>


<p>Since Gallon's classic investigation in the field of mental
imagery several similar investigations have been pursued in the
same direction, chiefly, however, for the purpose of discovering
and classifying types of imagination.</p>

<p>Little has been done in the line of developing and studying the
problems of the memory image proper, and still less, in fact
almost nothing, is to be found bearing on the control of the
visual memory image. The general fact of this control has
been presented, with greater or less detail, based upon returns
from questionaries. Gallon himself, for example, having referred
to instances in which the control was lacking, goes on
to say<a name="FNanchor_1_83" id="FNanchor_1_83"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_1_83'>1</a>: &quot;Others have complete mastery over their mental
images. They can call up the figure of a friend and make it
sit on a chair or stand up at will; they can make it turn round
and attitudinize in any way, as by mounting it on a bicycle or
compelling it to perform gymnastic feats on a trapeze. They
are able to build up elaborate structures bit by bit in their mind's
eye and add, substract or alter at will and at leisure.&quot;</p>

<p>More recent writers classify the students, or other persons
examined, according to these persons' own statements with regard
to the nature and degree of control over the mental images
which they consider themselves to possess. An article by
Bentley<a name="FNanchor_2_84" id="FNanchor_2_84"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_2_84'>2</a> is the only study of a specific problem of the memory
image. After a glance at the literature with reference to
methods pursued in the investigation of problems of memory
in general, Bentley outlines 'a static and genetic account' of
the memory image in particular, and presents details of experiments
'carried on for the special investigation of the visual
memory image and its fidelity to an original presentation.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[278]</span><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a>Of the many memory problems as yet unattacked, that of the
control of the mental image is one of the most interesting. The
visual image obviously offers itself as the most accessible and
the experiments described in this report were undertaken with
the purpose of finding out something about the processes by
which control of this image is secured and maintained. The
report naturally has two aspects, one numerical and the other
subjective, presenting the statements of the subjects as to their
inner experiences.</p>

<p>The term 'suppression' is used as a convenient one to cover
the enforced disappearance of the designated image, whether it
be directly forced out of consciousness (a true suppression) or
indirectly caused to disappear through neglect, or limitation of
the attention to the other image which is to be retained.</p>

<p>As this was an investigation of the control of memory images,
the presence of these images under conditions most favorable to
their vividness and distinctness was desirable. An immediate
mental recall at the end of five seconds of visual stimulation,
under favorable though not unusual conditions of light, position
and distance, seemed most likely to secure this desideratum. Experimentation
showed that five minutes was, on the whole, a
suitable period in which to secure the information needed without
developing a fatigue in the subject which would vitiate the
results.</p>

<p>The experiments made in the visual field were restricted to
visual memory images which were called up by the subject
during the five minutes succeeding a five seconds' presentation
of one or two objects. The subject sat, with his eyes closed,
about four feet from a wall or screen, before which the object
was placed. At a signal the eyes were opened, and at a second
signal five seconds later they were closed. If an after-image
appeared the subject reported its disappearance, and then called
up the image of the object just presented, and reported as to its
clearness, vividness, persistency and whatever phenomena arose;
and when directed he sought to modify the image in various
ways to be described later.</p>

<p>There were six subjects in experiments conducted during
the winter of 1900-1901, and six (five being new ones) in experiments
<span class="pagenum">[279]</span><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a>of the fall of 1901. They were all good visualizers,
though they differed in the readiness with which they visualized
respectively form or color.</p>

<p>The experiments of the first few weeks were designed to
establish the fact of control by the subjects over a single visual
memory image as to its position, size, outline, color, movement
and presence. In general it was established that a considerable
degree of control in these particulars existed in these
subjects.</p>

<p>Later, two objects were presented at a time, and were such
small articles as a glass ball, a book, a silk purse, an eye-glass
case, an iron hook, and so forth. Still later, colored squares,
triangles, or discs were used exclusively.</p>

<p>The investigation followed these lines: I. Movements of a
single image; II. Changes of color of a single image; III.
Movements of two images in the same and in different directions;
IV. Suppression of one of two images; V. Movements of a single
image, the object having been moved during the exposure.</p>

<h3>I. MOVEMENTS OF A SINGLE IMAGE.</h3>

<p>The first table gives the time in seconds taken to move
voluntarily a single image (of a colored square or disc) to the
right, left, up or down, and in each case to restore it to its
original position. There were thirty movements of each kind
for each of the six subjects, making one hundred and eighty for
each direction and also for each return, the total of all movements
being fourteen hundred and forty. The distance to which
the subjects moved the images was not fixed, but was in most
cases about twelve inches. The time was taken with a stop-watch,
and includes the time between the word of command,
'right,' etc., of the director and the verbal report 'now' of the
subject. It includes, therefore, for each movement two reaction
times. The subject reported 'now' the instant the color reached,
or appeared at, the designated place, not waiting for the completion
of the shape which usually followed. Two of the subjects
(H. and K.) took much longer than the other four, their
combined average time being almost exactly four times the
combined average time of the other four.<span class="pagenum">[280]</span><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a></p>

<p>The general averages for the different movements show that
movement to the right was hardest, to the left next; while
movement downward was the easiest. A marked exception is
seen in I., for whom the upward movement was the hardest and
movement to the right was the easiest. J. found movement to
the left hardest. For the return movements, the general averages
show that the return from the left is the hardest, from the

<h4>SUBJECTIVE.</h4>

<p>All the six subjects whose time records appear in Table I.
and also four others whose time was not recorded reported eye
<span class="pagenum">[281]</span><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a>movements, or a tendency to eye movement. A. and K. reported
that when the image was dim there was accommodation
as for long vision and when the image was vivid there was accommodation
as for near vision. B. ideated the new position
and the eye movement occurred automatically. G. reported a
contraction of the scalp muscles and a tendency to cast the eyes
up and locate the image at the back of the head inside; this was
an inveterate habit. He reported also accommodation for the
different distances of the image and an after-feeling of strain in
the head. H. reported a strong tendency in the eyes to return
to the center, <i>i.e.</i>, the original position, and to carry the image
back there. All the subjects frequently reported a sense of
relief in the eye muscles when the command to return the image
to the center was given&mdash;also, a tension in the forehead in the
upward movement which was accentuated (with H.) when there
was headache. J. reported, 'always eye strain,' and noticed
that the eyes usually turned as far as the new position, but
sometimes stopped short of it. K. reported first an eye movement,
then an ideation of the image in the new position. E.
and H. turned the head to right and left for movements of the
image in those directions. A., B., E. and F. believed that
they could inhibit the eye movement. Subjects were at times
unconscious of eye movements. H. articulated the names of
the colors of the image and found that it aided the movement of
the image to say to himself, for example: &quot;Don't you see that
blue square there?&quot;</p>

<p>All but J. reported a loss in vividness and also, though to a
less degree, in distinctness whenever the image was moved
away from the center. J. found no difference. H. reported
that details of the object which were reproduced in the image
when at the center were not discernible in the image in other
positions, also that at the left the image was more vivid than at
the right. B.'s memory image of a watch, three minutes after
it was called up, was still so clear that he read from it the time.
E., who was an experienced photographer, had no difficulty in
recalling outline, light and shade, but had difficulty in reproducing
color. I. frequently lost the form in making the required
improvements.<span class="pagenum">[282]</span><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a></p>

<p>Under manipulation the memory image usually retained its
distinctness and vividness with no loss or with but slight loss
when in its original position, to the end of the five minutes
of the experiment. The image, also, seldom disappeared except
for the momentary disappearances in passing from one
position to another, which are referred to later. Under passive
observation of the memory image disappearances, though of
short duration, were frequent and there was a noticeable fading
away of color and loss of outline.</p>

<p>The memory image almost without exception, when first
recalled, was located in the direction and at the distance of the
object presented.</p>

<p>In moving from the center to right and left the image remained
in the same plane with a few exceptions; in moving up
and down it moved on an arc whose center was at the eye.
This was especially true of the downward motion, which was
almost always to a greater distance than any of the other
motions.</p>

<p>C., D., F. and H. felt the need of a support for the image
in any except the central position. This was true especially of
the position above the center, but was entirely overcome by
practice by C., F. and H., and partially by D. In movements
where time was to be recorded, the distance was from six
to eighteen inches, but the image could be carried by all the
eleven subjects to any part of the room or beyond the room.
Usually the method followed was to fix the attention on the
suggested position and then the image appeared there, sometimes
complete at the outset, but usually in part at first, then
developing instantly to completion. When the subject was
requested to trace the image <i>in transitu</i>, this could usually be
accomplished, but the time was much longer. Frequently, in
such a case, the image was lost during the last third or fifth of
its journey. J. &quot;felt conscious of a something that went in
the suggested direction but did not develop details out of this
material; had to await development of the image at the new
locality.&quot; &quot;At times <i>forced</i> this development out of the vague
something that seemed to go over.&quot; G. had 'no feeling of
transition in space.' K. did not perceive the image <i>in transitu</i>.<span class="pagenum">[283]</span><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a>
I. perceived the image <i>in transitu</i> when the movement
was away from the center but when the image was to return to
the center its passage was too quick to be followed; 'it came
out at the center.'</p>

<p>J. noticed that in moving from the center the image took a
curved path towards himself, and that the position <i>to</i> which the
image moved always seemed further away than the position
<i>from</i> which it came, but the new position seemed to be readjusted
when the next movement occurred.</p>

<p>The return to the center seemed easier to all the subjects except
G., who was conscious of no difference between the movements
with respect to ease. Several described the return to the
center as like the return of a small ball snapped back by a
stretched elastic cord.</p>

<p>With D. a suggestion of weight in the perception of the object
was a hindrance to moving its memory image. Also the
image of a short piece of brass tubing persisted in rolling off
the table and along the floor and could not be held stationary.
Other objects rotated rapidly, and much effort was needed to
'slow down' the rotation and to bring the objects to rest and
keep them at rest.</p>


<h3>II. CHANGES OF COLOR OF A SINGLE IMAGE.</h3>


<p>Tables II. and III. show the results of experiments in changing
the color of a single image. This was usually a square,
sometimes a disc. The time of optical perception was five seconds.
After the disappearance of after-images, if there were
any, eighteen to twenty-four changes were made in the color of
the memory image, occupying from four and a half to six
minutes.</p>

<p>The colors were saturated blue, green, yellow and red, and
each one was changed into each of the other colors and then
restored. The order of change was varied to avoid uniformity
of succession. The four colors were shown to the subjects each
day before the experiments began, to establish a standard. The
time was taken with a stop-watch, and includes the time between
the director's word of command, 'green,' etc., and the
subject's report, 'now,' or 'green,' etc. It includes, therefore,
two reaction times. The subject reported 'now' the instant he
secured the desired color, not waiting for the completion of the
shape that usually followed.<span class="pagenum">[284]</span><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a></p>

<p>The six subjects fall into two groups&mdash;three, H., I., and K.,
taking longer than the other three. As in the previous experiment
H. was markedly longer than any of the others.</p>

<p>There were seventeen hundred and twenty-eight changes in
all, including returns to the original color. There were two
hundred and sixteen changes from each of the four colors as
presented, to each of the other three and, of course, the same
number of returns to the presented color.</p>

<p>The change to blue from the other presented colors was the

<p>The facts as to blue and yellow shown by these four tables
of averages may be expressed also in this way:</p>

<p>If a blue square was shown, it was easier to change the blue
memory image into the other colors, and also easier to get back
the blue memory image after such changes, than if any other of
the three colors was presented.</p>

<p>If another color than blue was shown it was harder to change
the memory image of that color to blue than to any of the other
colors, and also harder to get back to the memory image of that
color from blue than from any of the other three colors.</p>

<p>If a yellow square was shown, it was harder to change the
yellow memory image into the other colors, and also harder to
get back the yellow memory image after such changes than if
any other of the three colors was presented.</p>

<p>If another color than yellow was shown, it was easier to
change the memory image of that color to yellow than to any of
the three other colors, and also easier to get back to the memory
image of that color from the yellow than from any of the other
three colors except red.</p>

<p>If we combine <i>all</i> the changes into a color (both changes
from another presented color and returns to this color previously
presented) we find that changes to green are hardest, to yellow
easiest. The averages (for 432 exp. each) are,</p>

<p>As for the subjects, all six found yellow the easiest to change
into, one finding red equally easy.</p>


<h4>SUBJECTIVE.</h4>

<p>For seven of the subjects, mental repetition of the name of
the color (usually accompanied by articulatory movements)
tended to bring up the color, and one other subject occasionally
used this method of bringing about a change that was difficult.
With D. the color did not come at repetition of the name. G. was
assisted by auditory recall of the name. Nine subjects reported
a feeling of strain, usually in the eyes as of focusing, occurring
especially when there seemed a difficulty in producing the desired
change. The tension attended almost exclusively changes
of the presented color, not restorations of that color. For D.
this strain was considerable, for G. there was also an after-feeling
of strain in the head. For G. the image was clearest
when the feeling of strain was least, and J. secured the promptest
and clearest results when he could most nearly rid himself of
anxiety as to the result. K. in one instance (a change from
green to yellow) became conscious of the setting of his jaws
and motions of feet and body in aid of his attempt. H. frequently
had the feeling of physical fatigue.</p>

<p>In most cases the restoration of the presented color was as
a complete square, triangle, etc. In changes from the presented
color the new color appeared at a corner, or edge, or as a patch
at the center. With E. the &quot;color flashed over the whole field
and then had to be restricted to the figure.&quot; B. &quot;held the outline,
emptied of the old color, while it was filled in with the
new.&quot; D. &quot;had a clear outline, and the new color came in
small blotches inside, and effort spread them out to cover the
whole figure.&quot; For I. the &quot;new color came sliding in from
the right side over the old, which, however, disappeared as if
<span class="pagenum">[288]</span><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a>it were moving out of focus.&quot; With A. the new color usually
came from either the lower left-hand or the upper right-hand
corner. F. kept a clear outline and the new color came in from
the right.</p>

<p>When E. found it difficult to create at the center the desired
color, he thought of some object (garment, grass, sky, etc.) of
that color and then transferred it to fill in the outline preserved
at the center. B. moved the colored figure aside and in its place
put one of the desired color, moved the new figure up to the old
and there superposed it. With G. the new colors seemed of
new material and there was felt to be an accumulation about the
center, of old color-material. Then he located the square outside
of this imaginary debris and began again. H. found that
the colors of his own experiments, in which he used color
squares framed in black, came to his mind at the names of the
desired colors, and the association soon gave him the figure
also. I. located the new colors around the presented one, first
all at the right; then green at the left, red at the right, yellow
above, when presented blue was at the center; then yellow and
green were at the upper left-hand corner, while red came from
behind. The new color 'slid in over the old.' It was found
easier to secure the desired color when its position was known
beforehand. J. also used a similar device. He 'turned towards
the places and brought out the required color and filled
the central outline with it.' He tried to break up this scheme
and got red without going after it but found himself 'at a loss
to find the colors.' Later he succeeded so that the required color
simply appeared in the outline of the old color at the center.
K. turned his eyes to corners of the central outline, then to the
center, and found that this aided in developing the desired color
from the corners inward. When difficulty arose, he experienced
muscular tension in body and legs and jaws.</p>

<p>Five of the subjects considered the change from a presented
color to blue the hardest and one found the change to red
hardest. Green was placed second in difficulty by one, and
blue second by the one who found red the hardest. Three
reported the change to yellow the easiest and two the change to
red.<span class="pagenum">[289]</span><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a></p>

<p>The change from red to yellow caused 'an unpleasant sensation'
in C. and the new figure 'had a maroon halo.'</p>

<p>A. in returning from green or blue to yellow passed through
a gray; so, once, in changing from yellow to green, and once,
green to red. With A. blue retinal clouds, which often came,
aided changes to blue and hindered at times changes to other
colors. B. had a fusion of yellow and red in changing from
yellow to red. G. had a tendency to leave uncolored the
lower left-hand corner and it 'was wood-colored'; G. had a
gray image as the result of fusion of retinal clouds with red
memory image. With H. blue always came in as robin's-egg
blue, which then had to be changed to the standard blue. In
one instant the green memory image seemed to shift into a
purple and change to a positive retinal image which interfered
with changes to other colors. J. found whistling and
humming an aid in relaxing an unnatural state of tension which
would hinder the best results. To increase the vividness of the
image he would recall the black background on which the
colored squares had hung. In one experiment K. became
'desperately tired of yellow,' which was the presented color,
so that his 'mind was ready to jump to any color rather than
yellow.' The returns to yellow were, in this experiment, slower
than the changes from yellow.</p>

<p>The images sometimes changed sizes, being at times smaller,
but usually larger than the object. In one experiment of C. the
image was four times the size of the object, which was a green
square with sides of one inch.</p>


<h3>III. MOVEMENTS OF TWO IMAGES IN THE SAME AND IN
DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.</h3>


<p>Table IV. gives the results of experiments in the movements
of two images, the objects presented being colored squares or
discs. Time of perception was five seconds. After the disappearance
of after-images, if there were any, eighteen to twenty-four
movements with returns to original positions were made,
occupying five or six minutes. The colors were saturated blue,
green, yellow and red. Four of the movements were such as
separated the two images, and in four the two moved uniformly.<span class="pagenum">[290]</span><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>
The first four movements were right and left, left and right,
up and down, down and up; the left-hand object followed the
first direction indicated. The right-and-left movements involved
the crossing of the images. The last four were <i>both</i> to right, to
left, up, down. The time was taken with a stop-watch and includes
the time between the director's word of command and the
subject's report, 'now.' It includes, therefore, two reaction
times. The subject reported the instant the colors reached, or
appeared at, the suggested positions.</p>

<p>It is to be noticed that H. was very much slower than any
of the others in making the movements, both out and back; and
that K., while also slower (though much less so than H.) in
making the movements outward, was no slower in making the
return movements.</p>

<h4>SUBJECTIVE.</h4>

<p>In the experiments in which the time was recorded, there
was no disappearance of either image except where movements
were made successively. In these cases frequently the image
which was awaiting its turn vanished until the first image was
placed, a time varying from a quarter of a second to three or
four seconds. Occasionally the image already placed would
vanish, while the other was <i>en route</i>; the subject's attention in
both these cases being centered exclusively on the image he desired
to move. This was especially the case when the distances
to which the images were moved were great, as to the
ends of the room or to ceiling and floor. In other experiments,
where, after the movements took place, the images were held
for a short time, there were disappearances of one image or the
other ranging from one quarter of a second to fifteen seconds,
most of the absences, however, being under five seconds. The
absences were more numerous in the latter half of the five minutes
covered by the experiment. Occasionally a noise in the
adjoining room or in the street made the images disappear.</p>

<p>The greater ease of vertical as compared with horizontal
<span class="pagenum">[292]</span><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>movements recalls an observation of Ladd,<a name="FNanchor_3_85" id="FNanchor_3_85"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_3_85'>3</a> in which the idioretinal
light was willed into the shape of a cross. Ladd says:
&quot;The vertical bar of the cross seems much easier to produce
and to hold steadily in the field.&quot; This present observation is
also in accord with that described above in the case of movements
of a single image.</p>

<p>On several occasions G. reported that the crossing movement
was the easiest, and that the return to the original places was not
easier than the other movements. In one experiment he reported
the field at the center cloudy, so that it was a relief to get away
from it. G.'s time records on these occasions did not support his
feeling with regard to the return to the original places, but they
show that the crossing movements were, in two or three instances,
quicker than the 'left-and-right' movement, and the impression
of promptness thus made persisted to the end of the experiment.
The four movements in which both images moved uniformly
were easier than the four in which movements in different directions
were involved.</p>

<p>All the subjects were frequently conscious of eye movements,
and more frequently conscious of a tendency to eye movement,
which was, however, inhibited. That the strain in the eyes
was practically constant during all the movements away from
the original places, seems evident from the unanimous reports
of a sense of relaxing and relief in the eyes, attending the
movement of returning to the original places. The distance to
which the images were moved was a powerful factor in producing
this sense of strain. When the two images were moved
and held but a few inches apart there was no sense of strain
and no conscious alternation of attention. Practice increased
greatly the distance at which the images could be held apart
without conscious alternation of attention, but the strain of holding
them apart and of inhibiting eye movement increased with
the distance.</p>

<p>In the movements for which the time was recorded the distances
varied, according to the subject, from six to eighteen
inches, and varied at times with each subject. In the experiments
<span class="pagenum">[293]</span><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a>without time record, A., B., C., E., F. and H. reported
that they were able to move the images apart to ceiling and to
floor, or to the opposite ends of the room, and to hold them
there both in consciousness at the same time without either alternation
of attention or eye movement, a tendency to which
was felt but was inhibited. I. held them two feet apart without
fluctuation of attention. A. reported: &quot;I tend to turn my
body to left or to right when I move the images in either of
these directions.&quot; C., H. and I. said: &quot;The eyes diverge
when one image moves slowly to the right and one to the left.&quot;
D. found a slight movement of the eyes which could be detected
by the fingers placed lightly on the lids, when the attention was
alternating between the images. K. had convergence and divergence
of the eyes for crossing and separation respectively and
he was accustomed to run his eye over the outline of the image.
Strain in the scalp muscles was reported by A., B., E., F. and
G. The up-and-down movements were universally characterized
by a feeling as if one eye tended to move up and the other
down. C. unconsciously inclined his head to the left in such
movements as if to make the line of the two eyes parallel with
the direction of the movement.</p>

<p>E., when holding the images two feet apart, had a strong
feeling of difference of accommodation when alternating in
observation and so judged the two to be in different planes.</p>

<p>When the movement seemed difficult the strain was greater,
and when an image became dim the effort to restore its brightness
or its distinctness of outline was accompanied by a feeling
of bringing it nearer by accommodation and near focusing. J.
found that the two images approached each other when he attempted
to secure greater vividness. An analogous instance is
that of A.G.C., a subject quoted in 'Mental Imagery of
Students,' by French.<a name="FNanchor_4_86" id="FNanchor_4_86"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_4_86'>4</a> In calling up the image of a die this
subject held up his hand as if it held the die. When there was
no sense of strain the hand was fourteen inches from his face,
but when effort was made to image all the sides of the die at
once he unconsciously moved his hand to within four inches of
his eyes. French says in this connection: &quot;Situation depends
<span class="pagenum">[294]</span><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>on the attention involved and the inference is near that this
phenomenon may be connected with feelings of convergence
and accommodation which so often accompany concentrated
visual attention.&quot;</p>

<p>The movements were assisted by mentally saying, 'this
image is here, that image is there,' in the case of D., G., H.,
I. and K.; or, at times, by articulating the names of the
image, or of the color when the image was of a colored object.
I. found it easy to hold outlines, but in order to retain colors in
the movements of separation, he had to speak the names continually.
H. also repeated the names continually, as, for example,
'violet here, orange there.'</p>

<p>A. represented the line of vision as going to each of the two
images, which seemed connected by a line, thus making a triangle,
and then pictured himself as standing off and seeing
himself looking at the images. When the two objects were
solid and the images were to be crossed, B. carried one image
above or below the other, but when the objects were colored
surfaces he conceived them as pure colors so that there was no
sense of impenetrability to interfere with their crossing and they
glided by each other. In the up-and-down movements he
moved one at a time. C. and D. had to construct some support
for the images. In most of the experiments H. first moved
the images to a greater distance away, somewhat higher up
and a little farther apart. In this new position the images appeared
smaller and the suggested movements were made more
easily. Sometimes in crossing two colored images he observed
a partial mixture of the colors. J. found that a sharp movement
of the head in the required direction aided materially in
moving the images, and when the objects were colored surfaces
fastened to the same card he found it necessary either to conceive
the card as of rubber or to picture it as cut in two before
he could make the movements of the images.</p>

<p>With A., B., C. and D. there were instances of unwilled
movements of the images, in the experiments where the movements
were not timed. These were much more frequent with
D. than with the others, and to check them required prolonged
effort. The more common movements of this sort were rotation
<span class="pagenum">[295]</span><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>of the image, change of its position, separation of its parts (if
detachable in the object) and change of shape. E. had a return
of the two images of a preceding experiment which persisted
in staying a few seconds and which were as vivid as the two
legitimate occupants of the mental field.</p>

<p>The images were duplicated five times on different days with
A., and once each with C., F. and K.</p>

<p>A.'s cases were these. The 'wraith' of a small box whose
image was out at the right, appeared above the other image off
at the left and it was turned with a corner to the front. Again,
at the central position each image was duplicated, the true pair
being of full size, bright and distinct, the false pair small, dim
and on a more distant plane, <i>i.e.</i>, behind the others. One of
the extra images persisted against all effort to banish it, for
fifty-five seconds. Again, when twelve inches apart each image
was similarly duplicated. In the fourth instance the images
were at the center of the field. In the fifth, the right image,
eight inches from the center, was duplicated, the extra image
being still farther away and above. This second image was
very dark, dim and vague in outline, and came and went slowly.
The right image of C., when seven feet from the center, had a
dim double above it. F. had moved the right-hand image (a
violet disc) close to the left when a blue disc also appeared
above it. Though repeating the word 'violet' he had imaged
the violet disc as blue. K. was holding the two images a foot
and a half apart when an extra pair appeared at the center.
Both pairs persisted for sixty seconds and then the outer pair
vanished, and the inner, the false pair, grew brighter.</p>

<p>As was said in the case of a single image, so with double
images, the motion could be traced and often was traced when
the movements were away from the original positions, but on the
return to the original positions the images were not usually seen
<i>in transitu</i>. For ten of the subjects, the image moved downward
uniformly on an arc whose center was at the eye; and often the
right and left movements were likewise on an arc. With E. the
ends of the arc for motion right and left were higher also. H.,
I. and J. reported that all the movements were in the same
plane. The upward movement was always to a less distance
<span class="pagenum">[296]</span><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a>and the downward movement to a greater distance than the
horizontal movements.</p>

<p>In most cases the images were the size of the percepts, in a
number of cases smaller, and in a few cases larger. This was
determined by comparison between the image and the percept
immediately on opening the eyes and seeing the object at the
end of the five minutes occupied by the experiment. A similar
mode of comparison showed that, in about half of the experiments,
the images were at the end of five minutes approximately
equal to the percept in clearness and distinctness of outline. A
comparison of these results with those obtained in a series of experiments
involving passive observation of the image seems to
indicate that active manipulation of the image tends to maintain
the qualitative fidelity of the image when at its original
position. During the progress of the experiments the reports
were almost unanimous and constant that at its original position
the image was vivid and distinct, but lost in both respects when
away from that position, the loss being greater the greater the
distance to which it was moved. Frequently there was fluctuation,&mdash;a
loss of vividness and then a restoration,&mdash;which A.
frequently found to be rhythmical, while in general it was evident
that an increase of effort or of attention was successful in
restoring lost vividness and distinctness.</p>

<p>D., after three minutes, read the time in the image of a watch.
In superposing green on yellow, in two instances, the yellow
shone through, making a mixed color, and again, in moving a
green disc and a yellow disc, the green became suffused with
yellow, so that the two discs were one yellow and the other
greenish-yellow. For C., similarity in the two objects presented
tended to make both images less vivid and distinct and to render
more difficult their retention and manipulation. When one
of the two objects partially overlapped the other it was difficult
to separate the two images, and the area of contact was very
vague in the image of the under one, and when the scrutiny
reached that portion the other image returned to its original
overlapping position.<span class="pagenum">[297]</span><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a></p>


<h3>IV. SUPPRESSION OF ONE OF TWO IMAGES.</h3>


<p>The next tables (V. and VI.) give the results of experiments
in suppressing one of two images, the objects presented being
saturated color squares, discs, triangles, etc., placed side by
side, one above the other, or a smaller one superposed on a
larger. The time of perception was five seconds. After the
disappearance of after-images, if there were any, the subject was
directed to suppress one of the two memory images, the one to be
suppressed being indicated by the director. The subject reported
as soon as the indicated image disappeared, and reported any return
of the suppressed image and its later disappearance in consequence
of his efforts. Also he reported any disappearance and
reappearance of the retained image. Five minutes was the limit
of the time for the experiments with a few exceptions. The
times were recorded, and those given for the first suppression
include the time between the director's command and the subject's
report 'now' or 'gone,' and include, therefore, two reaction
times. The later suppressions include but one reaction
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[298]</span><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a>There were ten subjects in most of the experiments, and
the marked differences in the individual records which were
evident in the previous experiments did not exist here except
in the case of A., for whom alone the time required to obtain
the suppression exceeded the time of absence of the suppressed
image.</p>

<p>In several experiments the subjects were unable to suppress
the indicated image, which in five cases was the image at the
center of a disc and in two cases the outer portion of the disc.
Further, five failures were by one subject, D., and one each by

that A. and F. had less than half the number of experiments

<h4>SUBJECTIVE.</h4>

<p>Most of the subjects imaginatively placed the image to be
suppressed behind the screen, in a drawer, in their closed hands,
pushed it forward into the remote distance, sliced up, burned
up, or pulverized and so destroyed it. B. and D. 'thought it
away' directly, without mechanism or device, or got rid of it
'by a pure act of will.' Superposition was tried, frequently
with success, but at times the under image shone through.
When the objects were colored discs one superposed on the
other, the subject spread over the whole surface the color of
the image to be retained, but at times this resulted in there being
two shades of the upper color, and a yellow above a red changed
to an orange. When red was above yellow, the red appeared
more highly illuminated. Associations with objects of the color
of the retained image were found helpful but tended to modify
the original color. Such associations also, at times, by secondary
associations brought back the suppressed image. For
example, when thinking of buttercups to enforce a yellow image,
the picture of grass surrounding the flowers brought back the
<span class="pagenum">[301]</span><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a>suppressed green image. Concentration of the attention on the
image to be retained and an ignoring of the other was, on the
whole, the method usually and successfully followed. This
concentration was helped by imagining the image marked off
into minute squares which were carefully counted. Numerous
other devices of a similar character were used. Objects having
many details and those lending themselves readily to suggestions
of action (as a china animal) were the most helpful in enabling
the subject to concentrate his attention on their image to
the exclusion of another. Some subjects conceived themselves
as tracing with a pencil the outline and details of the retained
image. Frequently, when the two images were originally near
each other and one alone was being held by close scrutiny of
its parts, when this scrutiny reached the part of the image which
was nearest the position of the suppressed image, the suppressed
image returned. The original association between the two
images was often broken up by change of the position or shape
of the one to be suppressed. But devices soon became 'worn
out' and new ones had to be resorted to.</p>

<p>Motor impulses played a large part in the process of suppression,
such as head and eye movement away from the
image to be suppressed, contraction of the muscles of the
forehead and scalp, occasional 'setting' of the teeth, pressure
together of the hands when they were supposed to be holding
the image and of the knees under like circumstances. The
eye traced outline and details and the more actively it could be
so employed the more successful was the suppression. The
sensations of accommodation and of focusing previously referred
to were repeated in this series. Enunciation also was very
common.</p>

<p>Frequent comparison of the image with the percept was
made at the close of experiments and showed the utmost diversity
in size, vividness and distinctness. During an experiment
when the suppressed image came back, it was rarely more than
a mere blur of color; in two or three instances the form came
without color. Green was found to be a difficult color to hold.
C. had an orange after-image from a retained yellow image, a
red image having been suppressed. Between the images of a
<span class="pagenum">[302]</span><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a>gray disc and an orange disc, three inches apart, he had a blue
disc. J., while suppressing an orange disc and retaining a
green disc, noticed that 'when off the fovea the whole green
disc became bright orange.' There was always a sense of
readiness on the part of the suppressed image to slip back.
As C. expressed this, &quot;The thing suppressed exists in the
fringe of consciousness.&quot; The recurring image usually came
back at its original position even when the retained image was
being held in a different part of the field. In such cases the
retained image at once resumed its original place.</p>

<p>G. and J. were successful in proportion as they freed themselves
from the nervous strain of anxiety as to the result.</p>


<h3>V. MOVEMENTS OF A SINGLE IMAGE, THE OBJECT HAVING
BEEN MOVED DURING THE EXPOSURE.</h3>


<p>In an additional series of experiments with five of the same
subjects (B., G., H., I. and K.), the object was moved during
the five seconds of exposure either right, left, up or down, a
distance of about six to eight inches, and back again. In this
way the subject was supplied with further material of a pure
memory type and it was believed that some addition to our
knowledge of the nature of the control of the image might thus
be made by securing data contrasting the construction and the
more purely reminiscent work of the imagination.</p>

<p>The question proposed is as follows: Does the fact that a
certain movement of an object was presented to the optical perception
give an advantage in time, or ease, to the mental recall
of that object as so moving, over its recall as moving in other
directions? The subjective experiences during such recalls
may be expected to throw light upon the matter.</p>

<p>The subject, with closed eyes, was requested to move the
mental image of the object in the four directions indicated
above, returning it after each movement to its original position,
and the time of each movement was recorded and, as well, the
report of the subject with regard to his subjective experiences.
There were sixteen hundred movements in all, eight hundred
away from the original position of the image (two hundred
in each of the four directions mentioned above) and eight hundred
in returning to the original position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[303]</span><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a>Besides these experiments, other movements of the object
during exposure were made, such as inversion, rotation, change
from the vertical to the horizontal position and vice versa, rolling,
oblique movements and the subjective phenomena were
recorded when the subject had repeated with the image the
designated movements. In all the experiments the objects
were moved by the hand of the conductor of the experiment.</p>

<p>Table VII. gives the time record in seconds of these experiments
for each subject under each of the four variations:
Movement of the object to right, left, up, down.</p>

<h4>
NUMERICAL.</h4>

<p>As each movement may be compared with three other movements,
and as there were five subjects and four variations in the
conditions, there are sixty opportunities of comparing the time
required to move the image in the direction in which the object
was moved with the time taken to move it in the other directions.
In 45 instances the time was less, in 3 the same, and in 12
greater.</p>

<p>These twelve instances occurred with two subjects, three (to
left) occurring with K. and nine (three each right, up, down)
occurring with H. The cause was the same in all twelve instances,
both H. and K. reporting that (in these cases) they had
great difficulty in obtaining a reasonably vivid and distinct image
when directed to move the image in the direction in which the
<span class="pagenum">[305]</span><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a>object had been moved. The attempt to move the image resulted
in a vague image spread continuously over the entire area
that had been covered by the moving object, and the effort to
obtain the image at the desired position only was serious and
took an appreciably longer time than usual. It is to be noted,
also, that the time usually taken by H. is uniformly very much
greater than the time taken by the other subjects. Yet, even
with these instances included, the average time of all movements
of the image in the direction in which the object had
been moved is less than the average time of the other movements,
the former being 2.41 seconds, the latter, 2.59 seconds.</p>

and these movements seemed exact copies of the
original movement of the object, being purely reminiscent and
reproducing its irregularities when there were any. Also, the
image was usually seen <i>in transitu</i> both out and back, which
was never the case with Movements II. Eye movement and

<h2><a name="AES1" id="AES1"></a>THE STRUCTURE OF SIMPLE RHYTHM FORMS.</h2>

<h4>BY ROBERT MACDOUGALL.</h4>


<h3>I. PROBLEMS AND METHODS OF EXPERIMENTATION.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum">[309]</span><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a>The investigation of the problems presented by the psychological
phenomena of rhythm has of late years occupied much
attention and been pushed in a variety of different directions.
Some researches have been concerned with an analysis of rhythm
as an immediate subjective experience, involving factors of perception,
reaction, memory, feeling, and the like; others have
had to do with the specific objective conditions under which this
experience arises, and the effect of changes in the relations of
these factors; still others have sought to co&ouml;rdinate the rhythm
experience with more general laws of activity in the organism,
as the condition of most effective action, and to affiliate its complex
phenomena upon simpler laws of physiological activity and
repose; while a fourth group has undertaken a description of
that historical process which has resulted in the establishment
of artistic rhythm-types, and has sought to formulate the laws
of their construction.<a name="FNanchor_1_87" id="FNanchor_1_87"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_1_87'>1</a></p>

<p>This differentiation has already made such progress as to
constitute the general topic a field within which specialization
is called for, instead of an attempt to treat the phenomenon as
a whole. It is the purpose of this paper to describe a set of
experiments having to do with the second of these problems,
the constitution of objective rhythm forms. In the determination
of such forms it is, of course, impossible to avoid the employment
of terms descriptive of the immediate experience of
<span class="pagenum">[310]</span><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a>rhythm as a psychological process, or to overlook the constant
connection which exists between the two groups of facts. The
rhythm form is not objectively definable as a stable type of
stimulation existing in and for itself; the discrimination of true
and false relations among its elements depends on the immediate
report of the consciousness in which it appears. The artistic
form is such only in virtue of its arousing in the observer that
peculiar quality of feeling expressed in calling the series of
sensory stimuli rhythmically pleasing, or equivalent, or perfect.
In no other way than as thus dependent on the appeal which
their impression makes to the &aelig;sthetic consciousness can we
conceive of the development and establishment of fixed forms
of combination and sequence among those types of sensory
stimulation which arouse in us the pleasurable experience of
rhythm. The artistic rhythm form cannot be defined as constituted
of periods which are 'chronometrically proportionate,' or
mathematically simple. It is not such in virtue of any physical
relations which may obtain among its constituents, though it
may be dependent on such conditions in consequence of the
subordination to physical laws of the organic activities of the
human individual. The view must be subjectively objective
throughout.</p>

<p>The need for simplicity and exactness has led to the very
general employment of material as barely sensorial as could be
devised for the carrying on of experiments upon rhythm. Rich
tones and complex combinations of them are to be avoided, for
these qualities are themselves immediate sources of pleasure,
and the introduction of them into the material of experimentation
inevitably confuses the analysis which the observer is called
upon to make of his experience and of the sources of his pleasure
in it. Still more objectionable than the presence of such complex
musical tones in an investigation of rhythm is the introduction
of the symbols of rational speech in concrete poetical
forms. This element can be only a hindrance to the perception
of pure rhythmical relations, in virtue of the immediate
interest which the images called up by the verbal signs possess,
and further, in view of the fact that the connections of significant
thought impose upon the purely rhythmical formulation of
<span class="pagenum">[311]</span><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>the series of stimulations an unrelated and antagonistic principle
of grouping, namely, the logical relations which the various
members of the series bear to one another.</p>

<p>The demand for a simplification of the material which supports
the rhythm experience, for the purpose of obtaining a
more exact control over the conditions of experimentation, has
been met by the invention of a variety of devices whereby the
sequences of music, song and poetical speech have been replaced
by elementary conventional symbols as the vehicle of the
rhythmical impression or expression. On the one side there has
commonly been substituted for musical tones and rhythmical
speech the most simple, sharply limited and controllable sounds
possible, namely, those due to the action of a telephone receiver,
to the vibrations of a tuning-fork placed before the aperture of
a resonator, or to the strokes of metallic hammers falling on
their anvils. On the other side, the form of the reproduced rhythm
has been clarified by the substitution of the finger for the voice
in a series of simple motor reactions beaten out on a more or less
resonant medium; by the use&mdash;when the voice is employed&mdash;of
conventional verbal symbols instead of the elements of significant
speech; and&mdash;where actual verse has been spoken&mdash;by
a treatment of the words in formal staccato scansion, or by the
beating of time throughout the utterance. The last of these
methods is a halting between two courses which casts doubt on
the results as characteristic of either type of activity. There is
no question that the rhythmic forms of recitative poetry differ
vastly from those of instrumental music and chanted speech.
The measures of spoken verse are elastic and full of changefulness,
while those of music and the chant maintain a very decided
constancy of relations. The latter present determinable types
of grouping and succession, while it is questionable whether the
forms of relationship in spoken verse can ever be considered
apart from the emotion of the moment. In so far as the rhythmic
form which these differing modes of expression embody are to be
made the subject of experimental investigation their characteristic
structures should be kept intact as objects of analysis in
independent experiments, instead of being combined (and modified)
in a single process.<span class="pagenum">[312]</span><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a></p>

<p>The apparatus employed in the course of the present investigation
consisted of four different pieces of mechanism, one
affording the vehicle of expression throughout the series of reproduced
rhythms, the others providing the auditory material of the
various rhythms apperceived but not designedly reproduced.
The first of these consisted of a shallow Marey tambour, placed
horizontally upon a table with its rubber film upwards, and connected
by means of rubber-tubing with a pneumographic pen in
contact with the revolving drum of a kymograph. A Deprez
electric marker, aligned with the pneumographic stylus, afforded
a time record in quarter seconds. Upon this tambour, placed
within comfortable reach of the reactor's hand, the various
rhythm types were beaten out. The impact of the finger-tip on
the tense surface of the drum gave forth a faint and pleasing
but at the same time clearly discernible and distinctly limited
sound, which responded with audible variations of intensity to
the differing stresses involved in the process of tapping, and
which I have considered preferable to the short, sharp stroke of
the Kraepelin mouth-key employed by Ebhardt. The rate of
revolution in the drum was so adjusted to the normal range of
excursion in the pneumographic pen as to give sharp definition
to every change of direction in the curve, which hence allowed
of exact measurements of temporal and intensive phases in the
successive rhythm groups. These measurements were made to
limits of 1.0 mm. in the latter direction and of 0.5 mm. in the
former.<a name="FNanchor_2_88" id="FNanchor_2_88"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_2_88'>2</a></p>

<p>The second piece of apparatus consisted of an ordinary
metronome adjusted to beat at rates of 60, 90, and 120 strokes
per minute. This instrument was used in a set of preliminary
experiments designed to test the capacity of the various subjects
for keeping time by finger reaction with a regular series of auditory
stimulations.<span class="pagenum">[313]</span><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a></p>

<p>The third piece of apparatus consisted of an arrangement
for producing a series of sounds and silences, variable at will
in absolute rate, in duration, and, within restricted limits, in intensity,
by the interruptions of an electrical current, into the
circuit of which had been introduced a telephone receiver and
a rheostat. Portions of the periphery of a thin metallic disc
were cut away so as to leave at accurately spaced intervals,
larger or smaller extents of the original boundary. This
toothed wheel was then mounted on the driving-shaft of an Elbs
gravity motor and set in motion. Electrical connections and
interruptions were made by contact with the edge of a platinum
slip placed at an inclination to the disc's tangent, and so as to
bear lightly on the passing teeth or surfaces. The changes in
form of a mercury globule, consequent on the adhesion of the
liquid to the passing teeth, made it impossible to use the latter
medium. The absolute rate of succession in the series of
sounds was controlled by varying the magnitudes of the driving
weights and the resistance of the governing fans of the motor.
As the relation of sounds and intervals for any disc was unalterable,
a number of such wheels were prepared corresponding
to the various numerical groups and temporal sequences examined&mdash;one,
for example, having the relations expressed in
the <ins class="correction" title="ERRATUM: On page 313, line 23, the musical symbols should be a quarter note, accented, followed by an eighth note; in the following line the symbols should be a quarter note, accented, followed by two eighth notes.">
musical symbol</ins>
<img src="./images/327-music-1.png" width="98" height="30" alt="Music" title="" />
; another having that represented
in the symbol
<img src="./images/327-music-2.png" width="114" height="30" alt="Music" title="" />
and so on. Variations in
intensity were obtained by mounting a second series of contacts
on the same shaft and in alignment with those already
described. The number of these secondary contacts was less
than that of the primary connections, their teeth corresponding
to every second or third of those. The connections made by
these contacts were with a second loop, which also contained
within its circuit the telephone receiver by which the sounds
were produced. The rheostatic resistances introduced into this
second circuit were made to depart more or less from that of
the first, according as it was desired to introduce a greater or
slighter periodic accent into the series. This mechanism was
designed for the purpose of determining the characteristic
sequences of long and short elements in the rhythm group.</p>

<p>The fourth piece of apparatus consisted essentially of a horizontal
<span class="pagenum">[314]</span><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a>steel shaft having rigidly attached to it a series of metallic
anvils, fifteen in number, on which, as the shaft revolved, the
members of a group of steel hammers could be made to fall in
succession from the same or different heights. The various
parts of the mechanism and their connections may be readily
understood by reference to the illustration in Plate VIII. On
the right, supported upon two metal standards and resting
in doubly pivoted bearings, appears the anvil-bearing shaft.
On a series of shallow grooves cut into this shaft are mounted
loose brass collars, two of which are visible on the hither end
of the shaft. The anvils, the parts and attachments of which
are shown in the smaller objects lying on the table at the base
of the apparatus, consist of a cylinder of steel partly immersed
in a shallow brass cup and made fast to it by means of a thumb-screw.
This cup carries a threaded bolt, by which it may be
attached to the main shaft at any position on its circumference
by screwing through a hole drilled in the collar. The adjustment
of the anvils about the shaft may be changed in a moment
by the simple movement of loosening and tightening the thumb-screw
constituted by the anvil and its bolt. The device by
which the extent of the hammer-fall is controlled consists of
cam-shaped sheets of thin wood mounted within parallel grooves
on opposite sides of the loose collars and clamped to the anvils
by the resistance of two wedge-shaped flanges of metal carried
on the anvil bolt and acting against the sides of slots cut into
the sheets of wood at opposite sides. The periphery of these
sheets of wood&mdash;as exhibited by that one lying beside the loose
anvils on the table&mdash;is in the form of a spiral which unfolds in
every case from a point on the uniform level of the anvils, and
which, by variations in the grade of ascent, rises in the course
of a revolution about its center to the different altitudes required
for the fall of the hammers. These heights were scaled in
inches and fractions, and the series employed in these experiments
was as follows: 1/8, 2/8, 3/8, 5/8, 7/8, 15/8, 24/8 inch. Upon a corresponding
pair of standards, seen at the left of the illustration,
is mounted a slender steel shaft bearing a series of sections of
brass tubing, on which, in rigid sockets, are carried the shafts
of a set of hammers corresponding in number and position to
<span class="pagenum">[315]</span><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a>the anvils of the main axis. By means of a second shaft borne
upon two connected arms and pivoted at the summit of the
standards the whole group of hammers may at any moment be
raised from contact with the cams of the main shaft and the
series of sounds be brought to a close without interrupting the
action of the motor or of the remainder of the apparatus. By
this means phases of acceleration and retardation in the series,
due to initial increase in velocity and its final decrease as the
movement ceases, are avoided. The pairs of vertical guides
which appear on this gearing-shaft and enclose the handles of
the several hammers are designed to prevent injury to the insertions
of the hammer shafts in their sockets in case of accidental
dislocations of the heads in arranging the apparatus. This
mechanism was driven by an electrical motor with an interposed
reducing gear.</p>

<div class="center"><a name="PLATE8"></a><span class="sc">Psychological Review. Monograph Supplement, 17. Plate VIII.</span>
<a href="./images/329-plate8.jpg"><img src="./images/329-plate8_th.jpg" width="598" height="600" alt="PLATE VIII" title="" /></a>
<p class="sccaption">Opposite p. 314.</p></div>

<p>The intervals between the successive hammer-strokes are
controlled in the following way: on the inner face of the group
of pulleys mounted on the main shaft of the mechanism (this
gang of pulleys appears at the extreme right in the illustration)
is made fast a protractor scaled in half degrees. Upon the
frame of the standard supporting these pulleys is rigidly
screwed an index of metal which passes continuously over
the face of the scale as the shaft revolves. The points of attachment
(about the shaft) of the cams are determined by bringing
the point of fall of each cam in succession into alignment
with this fixed index, after the shaft has been turned through
the desired arc of its revolution and made fast by means of the
thumb-screw seen in the illustration at the near end of the shaft.
Thus, if three strokes of uniform intensity are to be given at
equal intervals apart and in continuous succession, the points of
fall of the hammers will be adjusted at equal angular distances
from one another, for example, at 360&deg;, 240&deg;, and 120&deg;; if the
temporal relations desired be in the ratios 2:1:1, the arrangement
will be 360&deg;, 180&deg;, 90&deg;; if in the ratios 5:4:3, it will
be 360&deg;, 210&deg;, 90&deg;; and so on. If double this number of hammers
be used in a continuous series the angular distances
between the points of fall of the successive hammers will of
course be one half of those given above, and if nine, twelve, or
fifteen hammers be used they will be proportionately less.<span class="pagenum">[316]</span><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a></p>

<p>An interruption of any desired relative length may be introduced
between repetitions of the series by restricting the distribution
of angular distances among the cams to the requisite
fraction of the whole revolution. Thus, if an interruption equal
to the duration included between the first and last hammer-falls
of the series be desired, the indices of position in the three cases
described above will become: 360&deg;, 270&deg;, 180&deg;; 360&deg;, 240&deg;,
180&deg;, and 360&deg;, 260&deg;, 180&deg;. In the case of series in which
the heights of fall of the various hammers are not uniform, a
special adjustment must be superimposed upon the method of
distribution just described. The fall of the hammer occupies an
appreciable time, the duration of which varies with the distance
through which the hammer passes. The result, therefore, of an
adjustment of the cams on the basis adopted when the height of
fall is uniform for all would appear in a reduction of the interval
following the sound produced by a hammer falling from a
greater height than the rest, and the amount of this shortening
would increase with every addition to the distance through
which the hammer must pass in its fall. In these experiments
such lags were corrected by determining empirically the angular
magnitude of the variation from its calculated position necessary,
in the case of each higher member of the series of distances,
to make the stroke of the hammer on its anvil simultaneous
with that of the shortest fall. These fixed amounts were
then added to the indices of position of the several cams in each
arrangement of intervals employed in the experiments.</p>

<p>This apparatus answers a variety of needs in practical
manipulation very satisfactorily. Changes in adjustment are
easily and quickly made, in regard to intensity, interval and
absolute rate. If desired, the gradation of intensities here employed
may be refined to the threshold of perceptibility, or
beyond it.</p>

<p>The possible variations of absolute rate and of relative intervals
within the series were vastly more numerous than the practical
conditions of experimentation called for. In two directions
the adaptability of the mechanism was found to be restricted.
The durations of the sounds could not be varied as were the intervals
between them, and all questions concerning the results of
<span class="pagenum">[317]</span><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a>such changes were therefore put aside; and, secondly, the hammers
and anvils, though fashioned from the same stuff and
turned to identical shapes and weights, could not be made to
ring qualitatively alike; and these differences, though slight,
were sufficiently great to become the basis of discrimination between
successive sounds and of the recognition upon their recurrence
of particular hammer-strokes, thereby constituting new
points of unification for the series of sounds. When the objective
differences of intensity were marked, these minor qualitative
variations were unregarded; but when the stresses introduced
were weak, as in a series composed of 3/8-, 2/8-, 2/8-inch
hammer-falls, they became sufficiently great to confuse or
transform the apparent grouping of the rhythmical series; for
a qualitative difference between two sounds, though imperceptible
when comparison is made after a single occurrence of
each, may readily become the subconscious basis for a unification
of the pair into a rhythmical group when several repetitions
of them take place.</p>

<p>In such an investigation as this the qualification of the subject-observer
should be an important consideration. The susceptibility
to pleasurable and painful affection by rhythmical
and arrhythmical relations among successive sensory stimuli
varies within wide limits from individual to individual. It
is of equal importance to know how far consonance exists
between the experiences of a variety of individuals. If the
objective conditions of the rhythm experience differ significantly
from person to person it is useless to seek for rhythm
forms, or to speak of the laws of rhythmical sequence. Consensus
of opinion among a variety of participators is the only
foundation upon which one can base the determination of
objective forms of any practical value. It is as necessary
to have many subjects as to have good ones. In the investigation
here reported on, work extended over the two
academic years of 1898-1900. Fourteen persons in all took
part, whose ages ranged from twenty-three to thirty-nine years.
Of these, five were musically trained, four of whom were also
possessed of good rhythmic perception; of the remaining nine,
seven were good or fair subjects, two rather poor. All of these
<span class="pagenum">[318]</span><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a>had had previous training in experimental science and nine were
experienced subjects in psychological work.</p>

<h3>II. THE ELEMENTARY CONDITIONS OF THE APPEARANCE
OF THE RHYTHM IMPRESSION.</h3>


<p>The objective conditions necessary to the arousal of an impression
of rhythm are three in number: (<i>a</i>) Recurrence; (<i>b</i>)
Accentuation; (<i>c</i>) Rate.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Recurrence.</i>&mdash;The element of repetition is essential; the
impression of rhythm never arises from the presentation of a
single rhythmical unit, however proportioned or perfect. It
does appear adequately and at once with the first recurrence
of that unit. If the rhythm be a complex one, involving the
co&ouml;rdination of primary groups in larger unities, the full apprehension
of its form will, of course, arise only when the largest
synthetic group which it contains has been completed; but an
impression of rhythm, though not of the form finally involved,
will have appeared with the first repetition of the simplest rhythmical
unit which enters into the composition. It is conceivable
that the presentation of a single, unrepeated rhythmical unit,
especially if well-defined and familiar, should originate a rhythmical
impression; but in such a case the sensory material which
supports the impression of rhythm is not contained in the objective
series but only suggested by it. The familiar group of
sounds initiates a rhythmic process which depends for its existence
on the continued repetition, in the form of some subjective
accentuation, of the unit originally presented.</p>

<p>The rhythmical form, in all such cases, is adequately and
perfectly apprehended through a single expression of the sequence.<a name="FNanchor_3_89" id="FNanchor_3_89"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_3_89'>3</a>
It lacks nothing for its completion; repetition can
add no more to it, and is, indeed, in strict terms, inconceivable;
for by its very recurrence it is differentiated from the initial
presentation, and combines organically with the latter to produce
a more highly synthetic form. And however often this process
<span class="pagenum">[319]</span><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a>be repeated, each repetition of the original sequence will have
become an element functionally unique and locally unalterable
in the last and highest synthesis which the whole series presents.</p>

<p>Rhythmical forms are not in themselves rhythms; they
must initiate the factor of movement in order that the impression
of rhythm shall arise. Rhythmical forms are constantly
occurring in our perceptional experience. Wherever a group
of homogeneous elements, so related as to exhibit intensive
subordination, is presented under certain temporal conditions,
potential rhythm forms appear. It is a mere accident whether
they are or are not apprehended as actual rhythm forms. If
the sequence be repeated&mdash;though but once&mdash;during the continuance
of a single attention attitude, its rhythmical quality
will ordinarily be perceived, the rhythmic movement will be
started. If the sequence be not thus repeated, the presentation
is unlikely to arouse the process and initiate the experience of
rhythm, but it is quite capable of so doing. The form of the
rhythm is thus wholly independent of the movement, on which
the actual impression of rhythm in every case depends; and it
may be presented apart from any experience of rhythm.</p>

<p>There is properly no repetition of identical sequences in
rhythm. Practically no rhythm to which the &aelig;sthetic subject
gives expression, or which he apprehends in a series of stimulations,
is constituted of the unvaried repetition of a single
elementary form, the measures,
<img src="./images/334-music.png" width="163" height="30" alt="Music" title="" /> for
example. Variation, subordination, synthesis, are present in
every rhythmical sequence. The regular succession is interrupted
by variant groups; points of initiation in the form of
redundant syllables, points of finality in the form of syncopated
measures, are introduced periodically, making the rhythm form
a complex one, the full set of relations involved being represented
only by the complete succession of elements contained
between any one such point of initiation and its return.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Accentuation.</i>&mdash;The second condition for the appearance
of the rhythm impression is the periodic accentuation of
certain elements in the series of sensory impressions or motor
reactions of which that rhythm is composed. The mechanism
of such accentuation is indifferent; any type of variation in the
<span class="pagenum">[320]</span><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a>accented elements from the rest of the series which induces the
characteristic process of rhythmic accentuation&mdash;by subjective
emphasis, recurrent waves of attention, or what not&mdash;suffices to
produce an impression of rhythm. It is commonly said that
only intensive variations are necessary; but such types of differentiation
are not invariably depended on for the production
of the rhythmic impression. Indeed, though most frequently
the basis of such effects, for sufficient reasons, this type of
variation is neither more nor less constant and essential than
other forms of departure from the line of indifference, which
forms are ordinarily said to be variable and inessential. For
the existence of rhythm depends, not on any particular type of
periodical variation in the sensory series, but on the recurrent
accentuation, under special temporal conditions, of periodic
elements within such a series; and any recurrent change in
quality&mdash;using this term to describe the total group of attributes
which constitutes the sensorial character of the elements
involved&mdash;which suffices to make the element in which it occurs
the recipient of such accentuation, will serve as a basis for the
production of a rhythmical impression. It is the fact of periodical
differentiation, not its particular direction, which is important.
Further, as we know, when such types of variation are
wholly absent from the series, certain elements may receive
periodical accentuation in dependence on phases of the attention
process itself, and a subjective but perfectly real and adequate
rhythm arise.</p>

<p>In this sense those who interpret rhythm as fundamentally
dependent on the maintenance of certain temporal relations are
correct. The accentuation must be rhythmically renewed, but
the sensory incentives to such renewals are absolutely indifferent,
and any given one of the several varieties of change ordinarily
incorporated into rhythm may be absent from the series without
affecting its perfection as a rhythmical sequence. In piano
playing the accentual points of a passage may be given by
notes struck in the bass register while unaccented elements are
supplied from the upper octaves; in orchestral compositions a
like opposition of heavy to light brasses, of cello to violin, of
cymbals to triangle, is employed to produce rhythmical effects,
<span class="pagenum">[321]</span><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a>the change being one in <i>timbre</i>, combined or uncombined with
pitch variations; and in all percussive instruments, such as the
drum and cymbals, the rhythmic impression depends solely on
intensive variations. The peculiar rhythmic function does not
lie in these elements, but in a process to which any one of them
indifferently may give rise. When that process is aroused, or
that effect produced, the rhythmic impression has been made,
no matter what the mechanism may have been.</p>

<p>The single objective condition, then, which is necessary to
the appearance of an impression of rhythm is the maintenance
of specific temporal relations among the elements of the series
of sensations which supports it. It is true that the subjective
experience of rhythm involves always two factors, periodicity
and accentuation; the latter, however, is very readily, and
under certain conditions inevitably, supplied by the apperceptive
subject if the former be given, while if the temporal conditions
be not fulfilled (and the subject cannot create them) no
impression of rhythm is possible. The contributed accent is
always a temporally rhythmical one, and if the recurrence of
the elements of the objective series opposes the phases of subjective
accentuation the rhythm absolutely falls to the ground.
Of the two points of view, then, that is the more faithful to the
facts which asserts that rhythm is dependent upon the maintenance
of fixed temporal intervals. These two elements cannot
be discriminated as forming the objective and subjective conditions
of rhythm respectively. Both are involved in the subjective
experience and both find their realization in objective expressions,
definable and measurable.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Rate.</i>&mdash;The appearance of the impression of rhythm is
intimately dependent on special conditions of duration in the
intervals separating the successive elements of the series.
There appears in this connection a definite superior limit to the
absolute rate at which the elements may succeed one another,
beyond which the rapidity cannot be increased without either
(<i>a</i>) destroying altogether the perception of rhythm in the series
or (<i>b</i>) transforming the structure of the rhythmical sequence by
the substitution of composite groups for the single elements of
the original series as units of rhythmic construction; and a less
<span class="pagenum">[322]</span><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a>clearly marked inferior limit, below which the series of stimulations
fails wholly to arouse the impression of rhythm. But
the limits imposed by these conditions, again, are co&ouml;rdinated
with certain other variables. The values of the thresholds are
dependent, in the first place, on the presence or absence of objective
accentuation. If such accents be present in the series,
the position of the limits is still a function of the intensive preponderance
of the accented over the unaccented elements of the
group. Further, it is related to the active or passive attitude of
the &aelig;sthetic subject on whom the rhythmical impression is made,
and there appear also important individual variations in the
values of the limits.</p>

<p>When the succession falls below a certain rate no impression
of rhythm arises. The successive elements appear isolated;
each is apprehended as a single impression, and the perception
of intensive and temporal relations is gotten by the ordinary
process of discrimination involved when any past experience is
compared with a present one. In the apprehension of rhythm
the case is altogether different. There is no such comparison
of a present with a past experience; the whole group of elements
constituting the rhythmic unit is present to consciousness
as a single experience; the first of its elements has never fallen
out of consciousness before the final member appears, and the
awareness of intensive differences and temporal segregation is
as immediate a fact of sensory apprehension as is the perception
of the musical qualities of the sounds themselves.</p>

<p>The absolute value of this lower limit varies from individual
to individual. In the experience of some persons the successive
members of the series may be separated by intervals as great as
one and one half (possibly two) seconds, while yet the impression
is distinctly one of rhythm; in that of others the rhythm dies
out before half of that interval has been reached. With these
subjects the apprehension at this stage is a secondary one, the
elements of the successive groups being held together by means
of some conventional symbolism, as the imagery of beating bells
or swinging pendulums. A certain voluminousness is indispensable
to the support of such slow measures. The limit is reached
sooner when the series of sounds is given by the fall of hammers
<span class="pagenum">[323]</span><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a>on their anvils than when a resonant body like a bell is struck,
or a continuous sound is produced upon a pipe or a reed.</p>

<p>In these cases, also, the limit is not sharply defined. The
rhythmical impression gradually dies out, and the point at which
it disappears may be shifted up or down the line, according as
the &aelig;sthetic subject is more or less attentive, more or less in the
mood to enjoy or create rhythm, more passive or more active in
his attitude toward the series of stimulations which supports the
rhythmical impression. The attention of the subject counts for
much, and this distinction&mdash;of involuntary from voluntary
rhythmization&mdash;which has been made chiefly in connection with
the phenomenon of subjective rhythm, runs also through all
appreciation of rhythms which depend on actual objective
factors. A series of sounds given with such slowness that at
one time, when passively heard, it fails to produce any impression
of rhythm, may very well support the experience on another
occasion, if the subject try to hold a specific rhythm form in
mind and to find it in the series of sounds. In such cases attention
creates the rhythm which without it would fail to appear.
But we must not confuse the nature of this fact and imagine that
the perception that the relations of a certain succession fulfil the
the form of a rhythmical sequence has created the rhythmical
impression for the apperceiving mind. It has done nothing of
the kind. In the case referred to the rhythm appears because
the rhythmical impression is produced, not because the fact of
rhythmical form in the succession is perceived. The capacity
of the will is strictly limited in this regard and the observer is
as really subject to time conditions in his effortful construction
as in his effortless apprehension. The rhythmically constructive
attitude does not destroy the existence of limits to the rate
at which the series must take place, but only displaces their
positions.</p>

<p>A similar displacement occurs if the periodic accentuations
within the series be increased or decreased in intensity. The
impression of rhythm from a strongly accented series persists
longer, as retardation of its rate proceeds, than does that of a
weakly accented series; the rhythm of a weakly accented series,
longer than that of a uniform succession. The sensation, in the
case of a greater intensive accent, is not only stronger but also
<span class="pagenum">[324]</span><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a>more persistent than in that of a weaker, so that the members
of a series of loud sounds succeeding one another at any given
rate appear to follow in more rapid succession than when the
sounds are faint. But the threshold at which the intervals between
successive sounds become too great to arouse any impression
of rhythm does not depend solely on the absolute loudness
of the sounds involved; it is a function also of the degree
of accentuation which the successive measures possess. The
greater the accentuation the more extended is the temporal
series which will hold together as a single rhythmic group.</p>

<p>This relation appears also in the changes presented in beaten
rhythms, the unit-groups of which undergo a progressive increase
in the number of their components. The temporal values of
these groups do not remain constant, but manifest a slight increase
in total duration as the number of component beats is increased,
though this increase is but a fraction of the proportional
time-value of the added beats. Parallel with this increase in
the time-value of the unit-group goes an increase in the preponderance
of the accented element over the intensity of the other
members of the group. Just as, therefore, in rhythms that are
heard, the greatest temporal values of the simple group are
mediated by accents of the highest intensity, so in expressed
rhythms those groups having the greatest time-values are marked
by the strongest accentuation.</p>

<p>Above the superior limit a rhythm impression may persist,
but neither by an increase in the number of elements which the
unit group contains, nor by an increase in the rate at which
these units follow one another in consciousness. The nature
of the unit itself is transformed, and a totally new adjustment
is made to the material of apprehension. When the number of
impressions exceeds eight or ten a second&mdash;subject to individual
variations&mdash;the rhythmical consciousness is unable longer to
follow the individual beats, a period of confusion ensues, until,
as the rate continues to increase, the situation is suddenly clarified
by the appearance of a new rhythm superimposed on the
old, having as its elements the structural units of the preceding
rhythm. The rate at which the elements of this new rhythm
succeed one another, instead of being more rapid than the old,
<span class="pagenum">[325]</span><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a>has become relatively slow, and simple groups replace the
previous large and complex ones. Thus, at twelve beats per
second the rhythms heard by the subjects in these experiments
were of either two, three or four beats, the elements entering
into each of these constituent beats being severally three and
four in number, as follows:</p>

<h5>TABLE I.</h5>

<div class="center"><table summary="Rythmic Name, Pattern" width="80%">
<colgroup valign="middle" span="4"><col align="left" /><col span="2" align="center" /><col align="left" /></colgroup>
<tr><td>Simple Trochaic,</td><td>four</td><td>beats per second:</td><td><img src="./images/340-table-1.png" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td>Dipodic Trochaic,</td><td>&quot;</td><td>&quot;</td><td><img src="./images/340-table-2.png" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td>Simple Dactylic,</td><td>three</td><td>&quot;</td><td><img src="./images/340-table-3.png" alt="" /></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The only impression of rhythm here received was of a trochaic
or dactylic measure, depending upon an accent which characterized
a group and not a single beat, and which recurred only
twice or thrice a second. Sometimes the subjects were wholly
unaware that the elements of the rhythm were not simple, a
most significant fact, and frequently the number reported
present was one half of the actual number given. During the
continuance of such a series the rhythm form changes frequently
in the apprehension of the individual subject from one
to another of the types described above.</p>

<p>It cannot be too strongly insisted on that the perception of
rhythm is an <i>impression</i>, an immediate affection of consciousness
depending on a particular kind of sensory experience; it
is never a construction, a reflective perception that certain relations
of intensity, duration, or what not, do obtain. If the
perception of rhythm in a series of impressions were dependent
on intellectual analysis and discrimination, the existence of such
temporal limits as are actually found would be inconceivable
and absurd. So long as the perception of the uniformity or
proportion of time-relations were possible, together with the discrimination
of the regular recurrence in the series of points of
accentuation, the perception of rhythm should persist, however
great or small might be the absolute intervals which separated
the successive members of the series. If it were the conception
of a certain form of relation, instead of the reception of a particular
<span class="pagenum">[326]</span><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a>impression, which was involved, we should realize a
rhythm which extended over hours or days, or which was comprehended
in the fraction of a second, as readily as those which
actually affect us.</p>

<p>The rate at which the elements of a series succeed one another
affects the constitution of the unit groups of which the
rhythmical sequence is composed. The faster the rate, the
larger is the number of impressions which enter into each
group. The first to appear in subjective rhythm, as the rate
is increased from a speed too slow for any impression of rhythm
to arise, are invariably groups of two beats; then come three-beat
groups, or a synthesis of the two-beat groups into four,
with major and minor accents; and finally six-and eight-beat
groups appear. When objective accentuation is present a similar
series of changes is manifested, the process here depending
on a composition of the unit-groups into higher orders, and not
involving the serial addition of new elements to the group.</p>

<p>The time relations of such smaller and larger units are dependent
on the relative inertia of the mechanism involved. A
definite subjective rhythm period undoubtedly appears; but its
constancy is not maintained absolutely, either in the process of
subjective rhythmization or in the reproduction of ideal forms.
Its manifestation is subject to the special conditions imposed on
it by such apprehension or expression. The failure to make
this distinction is certain to confuse one's conception of the temporal
rhythmic unit and its period. The variations of this period
present different curves in the two cases of subjective
rhythmization and motor expression of definite rhythm forms.
In the former the absolute duration of the unit-group suffers
progressive decrease as the rate of succession among the stimuli
is accelerated; in the latter a series of extensions of its total duration
takes place as the number of elements composing the unit
is increased. The series of relative values for units of from two
to eight constituents which the finger reactions presented in this
investigation is given in the following table:<span class="pagenum">[327]</span><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a></p>

</table></div>


<p>This progressive extension of the rhythm period is to be explained
by the mechanical conditions imposed on the expression
of rhythm by processes of muscular contraction and release.
Were it possible freely to increase the rate of such successive
innervations, we should expect to find a much greater constancy
in the whole period occupied by the series of reactions which
composes the unit. The comparatively unsatisfactory quality of
these larger series, and the resolution of them into subgroups
described elsewhere in this paper, are due to this inability to accommodate
the series of motor reactions to the subjective rhythm
period.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the temporal value of the unit which appears
as the result of subjective rhythmization undergoes a progressive
decrease in absolute magnitude as the rate of succession
among the undifferentiated stimuli is accelerated. The
series of values for units containing from two to eleven constituents
is given in the following table:</p>

<h5>TABLE III.</h5>

<div class="center"><table summary="TABLE III" width="33%">

<tr><td>Seven,</td><td>1.75</td></tr>
<tr><td>Nine,</td><td>1.50</td></tr>
<tr><td>Eleven,</td><td>0.97</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>If the time-value of the simple rhythm group here depended
solely on the relation of the successive stimuli to the subjective
rhythm period, no progressive diminution should be presented,
for in proportion as the absolute value of the separating intervals
decreases the true nature of this period should be more
<span class="pagenum">[328]</span><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a>clearly manifested. It is scarcely to be doubted that the complexity
of its content is likewise a determinant of the temporal
value of this period, and that to this factor is to be attributed
the changes which are here presented.<a name="FNanchor_4_90" id="FNanchor_4_90"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_4_90'>4</a></p>

<p>In subjective rhythmization the number of elements which
compose the unit is dependent solely on the relation of the subjective
rhythm period to the rate of succession among such
elements. In objective rhythm, as has been pointed out, a free
treatment of the material is rendered impossible by the determination
of specific points of increased stress, in virtue of which
a new unit of change appears, namely, the whole period elapsing
from any one occurrence of accentuation to its return.</p>

<p>But this is not the sole determinant of the numerical limits
of the simple group in such objective rhythms. The structural
unit must indeed adhere to the scheme given by the period of
the recurrent accentuation; but the point at which simple successions
of this figure give place to complex structures (at which
<img src="./images/343-music-1.png" width="64" height="30" alt="MUSIC" /> is replaced
by <img src="./images/343-music-2.png" width="121" height="30" alt="MUSIC" />, for example) may
conceivably be hastened or retarded by other factors than that
of the simple rate of succession. The degrees of segregation
and accentuation which characterize the rhythmic unit are elements
which may thus affect the higher synthesis. Increase in
either of these directions gives greater definition to the rhythmic
figure and should tend to preserve the simple group in consciousness.
The latter relation was not made the subject of special
investigation in this research. The former was taken up at a
single point. The sounds were two in number, alternately accented
and unaccented, produced by hammer-falls of 7/8 and 1/8
inch respectively. These were given at three rates of succession,
and three different degrees of segregation were compared together.
In the following table is given, for six subjects, the
<span class="pagenum">[329]</span><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a>average number of elements entering into the group-form,
simple or complex, under which the rhythm was apprehended:</p>

<h5>TABLE IV.</h5>

<div class="center"><table summary="TABLE IV">
<colgroup span="5"><col align="left" /><col span="4" align="right" /></colgroup>
<tr><th>Ratio of Beat-interval</th><th></th><th colspan="3" align="center">Value in Seconds of Average Interval,</th></tr>

<tr><td>1.000: 0.714</td><td></td><td>5.2</td><td>8.4</td><td>10.8</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The quantitative relations presented by these figures are
consistent throughout. For every rate of speed the average
rhythmic group is smallest when the interval separating the
successive groups is at its maximum; it is largest when this
interval is at its minimum; while in each case a median value
is presented by the relation of uniformity among the intervals.
In the second as well as the first of the ratios included in the
foregoing table the interval which separates adjacent groups is
felt to be distinctly longer than that internal to the group; in the
third the relative durations of the two intervals are those which
support psychological uniformity. In the latter case, in consequence
of the freer passage from group to group, the continuity
of the rhythmical series is more perfectly preserved than
in the former, and the integration of its elements into higher
syntheses more extended.</p>

<p>The extension of the numerical limits of the rhythm group
in subjective rhythm which appear in consequence of progressive
acceleration in the rate of succession is given for a series of six
different values of the separating intervals in the following table,
the figures of which represent the average for six observers:</p>

</table></div>

<p>The rate of increase here presented in the number of elements
is not sufficiently rapid to counterbalance the acceleration of
<span class="pagenum">[330]</span><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a>speed and maintain a constancy in the duration of the group.
The greatest value of this period is co&ouml;rdinated with the slowest
rate of succession, the lowest with the most rapid. As the speed
increases, the duration of the rhythmic unit is shortened. Its
average duration for all rates here included is 1.680 sec., or,
without the first of the series (one-second intervals, at which
only two of the observers received the impression of rhythm),
1.516 sec. These values are not for the simplest combinations,
but for the highest synthetical unit which was immediately apprehended
in the series of stimulations. This compounding
becomes more pronounced as the rate of succession is accelerated,
but even at intervals of 5/12 and 7/12 sec. it is the characteristic
mode of apprehension.</p>

<p>The number of elements in the simple groups of which these
higher units are composed, and their average duration, are also
given in the table. These likewise show a progressive increase
in number, but of a much slower rate than that manifested by
the total synthesis of elements. That is to say, in subjective
rhythm as well as in objectively figured series, subordinate
rhythmical differences in the material sink out of consciousness
less rapidly than the inclusion of fresh elements takes place; in
other words, the organic complexity of the rhythmic unit increases
with every acceleration in the rate of succession. The
duration of these simple structural groups, as may be inferred,
decreases with such acceleration, but at a much more rapid rate
than is the case with the total reach of rhythmical apprehension,
the value of that unit which appears in connection with the highest
speed here included being less than half a second. The
'liveliness' of such rapid measures is thus a resultant of several
factors. It is not a consequence solely of the more rapid rate
at which the individual stimuli succeed one another, but depends
also on the shortening of the periods of both these rhythmical
units and on the progressive divergence of the simple from the
complex group.</p>

<p>The influence of the rate of succession on the rhythmical
unit is not confined to its segregation from adjacent groups, but
affects the internal configuration of the measure as well. With
every acceleration in rate the relative preponderance of the
<span class="pagenum">[331]</span><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a>interval following the accented element (in rhythms having initial
stress) increases; as the rate is retarded, smaller and
smaller degrees of difference in the values of accented and unaccented
intervals are discriminated. In this regard the influence
of reduction in the absolute value of the separating intervals
is analogous to that of increased accentuation within the group.
In fast tempos and with high degrees of emphasis the interval
following the initial accent is relatively longer, that following
the unaccented relatively shorter, than at slow tempos and with
weak emphasis. This is but another way of expressing the
fact that as the elements of the auditory series succeed one
another more and more slowly the impression of rhythm fades
out and that as their succession increases in rapidity the impression
becomes more and more pronounced. The following
table presents these relations in a quantitative form for trochaic
rhythm. The figures represent the number of times the second,
or group interval, was judged to be greater than, equal to, or
less than the first or internal interval of the group. Three rates
were compared together, having average intervals of 5/12, 3/12
and 2/12 sec. Six observers took part, but only a small number
of judgments was made by each, to which fact is probably to be
attributed the irregularities of form which appear in the various
curves:</p>

<p>Within the limits of its appearance, as the figures just presented
indicate, the force, definition and persistency of the
rhythmical impression do not continue uniform. At the lowest
rates at which rhythm appears the integration of the successive
groups is weak and their segregation indistinct. As the rate
increases the definition of the rhythmic form grows more precise,
group is separated from group by greater apparent intervals,
<span class="pagenum">[332]</span><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a>and the accentuation of the groups becomes more pronounced.
In subjective rhythmization of an undifferentiated
series, likewise, the impression of segregation and periodic
accentuation grows more forcible and dominating as the rate
increases. The sensitiveness to form and dynamic value in the
successive groups also increases up to a certain point in the
process of acceleration. As expressed in the capacity to discriminate
departures from formal equivalence among the groups,
this function reached its maximum, for those concerned in this
investigation, at rates varying individually from 0.3 sec. to 0.6
sec. in the value of their intervals.</p>

<p>It is in virtue of its nature as an impression, as opposed to a
construction, that every structural unit, and every rhythmical
sequence into which it enters, possesses a distinct individual
quality, by which it is immediately apprehended and discriminated
from other forms, as the face of an acquaintance is remembered
and identified without detailed knowledge of the
character of any feature it possesses. For what persists from
the reception of a rhythm impression and becomes the basis of
future recognition and reproduction of it, is not the number of
beats in a unit or sequence, nor the absolute or relative intensity
of the components of the group; it is the quality of the groups
as individuals, and the form of the sequence as a whole. The
phrase and verse are as vividly conceived as the unit group;
the stanza or the passage is apprehended as immediately and
simply as the bar or the measure. Of the number and relation
of the individual beats constituting a rhythmical sequence there
is no awareness whatever on the part of the &aelig;sthetic subject.
I say this without qualification. So long as the rhythmical impression
endures the analytic unit is lost sight of, the synthetic
unit, or group, is apprehended as a simple experience. When
the rhythm function is thoroughly established, when the structural
form is well integrated or familiar, it becomes well-nigh
impossible to return to the analytic attitude and discern the
actual temporal and intensive relations which enter into the
rhythm. Even the quality of the organic units may lapse from
distinct consciousness, and only a feeling of the form of the
whole sequence remain. The <i>Gestaltsqualit&auml;t</i> of the passage or
<span class="pagenum">[333]</span><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a>the stanza is thus frequently appreciated and reproduced without
an awareness of its sequential relations, though with the
keenest sense of what is necessary to, or inconsistent with, its
structure; so that the slightest deviation from its form is remarked
and the whole sequence accurately reproduced.</p>

<p>In order to isolate and exhibit the tendency toward rhythmization
in regularly repeated motor reactions, one should examine
series of similar movements made at different rates both as an
accompaniment to a recurrent auditory stimulus and as free expressions
of the motor impulse independent of such objective
control. In the former of these cases the series of stimuli
should be undifferentiated in quality as well as uniform in time.
The rhythm which appears in such a case will contradict the
phases of an objective series which prescribes its form, and the
evidence of its existence, presented under such adverse conditions,
should be indubitable.</p>

<p>As preliminary to their special work the members of the experimental
group were tested in regard to the promptness and
regularity of their reactions (by finger flexion) in accompanying
a periodically recurrent stimulus given by the beating of a
metronome; records were taken also of their capacity to estimate
and maintain constant time relations by freely tapping at
intervals of one, two and five seconds. Of the latter type of
reaction the records show that a temporal grouping of the reactions
is presented in every rate of tapping. This, owing to the
large absolute intervals, is uniformly in groups of two, the first
member of which is of shorter, the second of longer duration.
There is likewise an intensive differentiation of the alternate
reactions. Thus a double rhythmical treatment appears, but
while with intervals of two seconds the phases of temporal and
intensive rhythm coincide, at rates of one and five seconds they
are opposed, that is, the accentuation falls on the initial reaction
which is followed by the shorter interval. This doubtlessly
marks the emergence of that tendency to initial accentuation
which was subsequently found to prevail in all expression of
rhythm.</p>

<p>The types of reaction which these records afford leave no
doubt that a fuller investigation of the matter would show the
<span class="pagenum">[334]</span><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a>constant presence, in all such forms of activity, of a rhythmical
automatization of the series. The special problems which such
an investigation should first resolve, relate to the dependence of
the amount of rhythmical differentiation on the rate of succession
among the reactions; the relation of the form of this
reaction series to factors of attention and control; and the significance,
in connection with the process of rhythmization, of
auditory stimuli produced by and accompanying the reaction
series, that is, the comparison of soundless and sounded reactions.</p>

<p>In the second set of experiments the reactor was directed
simply to accompany the beating of a metronome by a light
tapping with the forefinger on a rubber-surfaced tambour connected
with a pneumographic registering pen, with which was
aligned an electrical time-marker also actuated by the metronome.
Three rates of tapping were adopted, 60, 90 and 120
beats per minute. No specific instructions were given as to direction
or keenness of attention on the part of the reactor; the
most natural and simple accompaniment was desired. Occasionally,
for comparison, the reactor was directed to attend
closely to each successive beat as it occurred.</p>

<p>Certain questions as to the applicability of the material here
interpreted to the point in question, and as to its relation to the
objective conditions of experimentation, must be met at the outset.
The first of these is as to the actual uniformity of the metronome
series. Objective determination of its temporal regularity
is unnecessary (in so far as such a determination looks
toward an explanation of the form of tapping by reference to
inequality in the metronomic intervals). That the rhythmical
phases which appear in the accompaniment are not due to inequality
in the stimulation intervals, is shown by the reversal of
relations between the metronome and its accompaniment which
occur in the midst of a continuous series of taps. To speak
roughly, a break occurs every twentieth beat. I do not refer
to minor irregularities occurring within the single group but
not affecting the form of the rhythmical accompaniment. The
latter appeared with surprising rarity, but when found were
included in the continuous calculation of averages. But in
every score or so of beats a stroke out of series would be interpolated,
<span class="pagenum">[335]</span><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a>giving the form  | 1 &gt;2 1 2 &gt;1 |; the accompaniment
being co&ouml;rdinated during the second portion of the whole
series with opposite phases of the metronome from those with
which its elements were connected in the earlier part. Moreover,
the dependence of this grouping of the sounds on subjective
attitudes may readily be made to appear. When attention
is turned keenly on the process its phases of rhythmical
differentiation decline; when the accompaniment becomes mechanical
they mount in value. When the observer tries to mark
the ticking as accurately as possible, not only does the index of
his motor reactions become more constant, but the sounds of the
instrument likewise appear more uniform. The observers report
also that at one and the same time they are aware of the regularity
of the metronome and the rhythmical nature of their tapping,
while yet the conviction remains that the accompaniment
has been in time with the beats. Furthermore, if the phases of
ticking in the metronome were temporarily unlike, the motor
accompaniment by a series of observers, if accurate, should reproduce
the time-values of the process, and if inaccurate, should
present only an increase of the mean variation, without altering
the characteristic relations of the two phases. On the other
hand, if the series be uniform and subjectively rhythmized by
the hearer, there should be expected definite perversions of the
objective relations, presenting a series of increasing departures
from the original in proportion as the tendency to rhythmize
varied from individual to individual.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a rhythm is already presented in the
sounds of the metronome, occasioned by the qualitative differentiation
of the members of each pair of ticks, a variation
which it was impossible to eliminate and which must be borne
in mind in estimating the following results.</p>

<p>Five reactors took part in the experiment, the results of
which are tabulated in the following pages. The figures are
based on series of one hundred reactions for each subject, fifty
accompaniments to each swing and return of the metronome
pendulum. When taken in series of ten successive pairs of
reactions, five repetitions of the series will be given as the basis
of each average. The quantitative results are stated in Tables<span class="pagenum">[336]</span><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a>
VII.-XIV., which present the proportional values of the time
intervals elapsing between the successive reactions of an accompaniment
to the strokes of a metronome beating at the rates of
60, 90 and 120 per minute.</p>

<p>These figures present a double process of rhythmic differentiation,
intensively into stronger and weaker beats, and temporally
<span class="pagenum">[338]</span><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a>into longer and shorter intervals. The accentuation of
alternate elements has an objective provocative in the qualitative
unlikeness of the ticks given by the swing and return of the
pendulum. This phase is, however, neither so clearly marked
nor so constant as the temporal grouping of the reactions. In
three cases the accent swings over to the shorter interval, which,
according to the report of the subjects, formed the initial member
of the group when such grouping came to subjective notice. This
latter tendency appears most pronounced at the fastest rate of
reaction, and perhaps indicates a tendency at rapid tempos to
prefer trochaic forms of rhythm. In temporal grouping the co&ouml;rdination
of results with the succession of rates presents an
exception only in the case of one subject (XV. B, Rate 120),
and the various observers form a series in which the rhythmizing
tendency becomes more and more pronounced.</p>

<p>Combining the reactions of the various subjects, the average
for all shows an accentuation of the longer interval, as
follows:</p>

<p>The rhythmical differentiation of phases is greatest at the
slowest tempo included in the series, namely, one beat per
second, and it declines as the rate of succession increases. It
is impossible from this curve to say, however, that the subjective
rhythmization of uniform material becomes more pronounced
in proportion as the intervals between the successive stimulations
increase. Below a certain rapidity the series of sounds
fails wholly to provoke the rhythmizing tendency; and it is
conceivable that a change in the direction of the curve may
occur at a point beyond the limits included within these data.</p>

<p>The introduction from time to time of a single extra tap,
with the effect of transposing the relations of the motor accompaniment
to the phases of the metronome, has been here interpreted
as arising from a periodically recurring adjustment of
the reaction process to the auditory series which it accompanies,
<span class="pagenum">[339]</span><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a>and from which it has gradually diverged. The departure is in
the form of a slow retardation, the return is a swift acceleration.
The retardation does not always continue until a point is reached
at which a beat is dropped from, or an extra one introduced
into, the series. In the course of a set of reactions which presents
no interpolation of extra-serial beats periodic retardation
and acceleration of the tapping take place. This tertiary
rhythm, superimposed on the differentiation of simple phases,
has, as regards the forms involved in the present experiments, a
period of ten single beats or five measures.</p>

<p>From the fact that this rhythm recurs again and again without
the introduction of an extra-serial beat it is possible to infer
the relation of its alternate phases to the actual rate of the
metronome. Since the most rapid succession included was two
beats per second, it is hardly conceivable that the reactor lost
count of the beats in the course of his tapping. If, therefore,
the motor series in general parallels the auditory, the retardations
below the actual metronome rate must be compensated by periods
of acceleration above it. Regarded in this light it becomes
questionable if what has been called the process of readjustment
really represents an effort to restore an equilibrium between
motor and auditory processes after an involuntary divergence.
I believe the contrasting phases are fundamental, and that the
changes represent a free, rhythmical accompaniment of the objective
periods, which themselves involve no such recurrent
differentiation.</p>

<p>Of the existence of higher rhythmic forms evidence will be
afforded by a comparison of the total durations of the first
and second five-groups included in the decimal series. Difference
of some kind is of course to be looked for; equivalence
between the groups would only be accidental, and inequality,
apart from amount and constancy, is insignificant. In the results
here presented the differentiation is, in the first place, of
considerable value, the average duration of the first of these
groups bearing to the second the relation of 1.000:1.028.</p>

<p>Secondly, this differentiation in the time-values of the respective
groups is constant for all the subjects participating. The ratios
in their several cases are annexed:<span class="pagenum">[340]</span><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340"></a></p>

<p>It is perhaps significant that the extent of this differentiation&mdash;and
inferably the definition of rhythmical synthesis&mdash;corresponds
to the reported musical aptitudes of the subjects; J. is
musically trained, K. is fond of music but little trained, N. is
without musical inclination.</p>

<p>The relations of these larger rhythmical series repeat those
of their constituent groups&mdash;the first is shorter, the second
longer. The two sets of ratios are brought together for comparison
in the annexed table:</p>

<p>It is to be noted here, as in the case of beating out specific
rhythms, that the index of differentiation is greater in simple
than in complex groups, the ratios for all subjects being, in
simple groups, 1.000:1.356, and in series of five, 1.000:1.026.</p>

<p>There is thus present in the process of mechanically accompanying
a series of regularly recurring auditory stimuli a complex
rhythmization in the forms, first, of a differentiation of
alternate intervals, and secondly, of a synthesis of these in
larger structures, a process here traced to the third degree, but
which may very well extend to the composition of still more
comprehensive groups. The process of reaction is permeated
through and through by rhythmical differentiation of phases, in
which the feeling for unity and equivalence must hold fast
through really vast periods as the long slow phases swing back
and forth, upon which takes place a swift and yet swifter oscillation
of rhythmical values as the unit groups become more
limited, until the opposition of single elements is reached.<span class="pagenum">[341]</span><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a></p>


<h3>III. THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RHYTHMICAL UNIT.</h3>


<h3>A. <i>The Number of Elements in the Group and its Limits.</i></h3>

<p>The number of elements which the rhythmical group contains
is related, in the first place, to the rate of succession among
the elements of the sequence. This connection has already
been discussed in so far as it bears on the forms of grouping
which appear in an undifferentiated series of sounds in consequence
of variations in the absolute magnitude of the intervals
which separate the successive stimuli. In such a case the number
of elements which enter into the unit depends solely on the rate
of succession. The unit presents a continuous series of changes
from the lowest to the highest number of constituents which the
simple group can possibly contain, and the synthesis of elements
itself changes from a succession of simple forms to structures
involving complex subordination of the third and even fourth
degree, without other change in the objective series than variations
in tempo.</p>

<p>When objectively defined rhythm types are presented, or
expression is given to a rhythm subjectively defined by ideal
forms, these simple relations no longer hold. Acceleration or
retardation of speed does not unconditionally affect the number
of elements which the rhythm group contains. In the rhythmization
of an undifferentiated series the recurrence of accentuation
depends solely on subjective conditions, the temporal relations
of which can be displaced only within the limits of single
intervals; for example, if a trochaic rhythm characterizes a
given tempo, the rhythm type persists under conditions of progressive
acceleration only in so far as the total duration of the
two intervals composing the unit approximates more closely to
the subjective rhythm period than does that of three such intervals.
When, in consequence of the continued reduction of the
separating intervals, the latter duration presents the closer approximation,
the previous rhythm form is overthrown, accentuation
attaches to every third instead of to alternate elements, and
a dactylic rhythm replaces the trochaic.</p>

<p>In objective rhythms, on the other hand, the determination
of specific points of increased stress makes it impossible thus to
<span class="pagenum">[342]</span><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a>shift the accentuation back and forth by increments of single
intervals. The unit of displacement becomes the whole period
intervening between any two adjacent points of accentuation.
The rhythm form in such cases is displaced, not by those of
proximately greater units, but only by such as present multiples
of its own simple groups. Acceleration of the speed at which
a simple trochaic succession is presented results thus, first, in a
more rapid trochaic tempo, until the duration of two rhythm
groups approaches more nearly to the period of subjective
rhythmization, when&mdash;the fundamental trochaism persisting&mdash;the
previous simple succession is replaced by a dipodic structure
in which the phases of major and minor accentuation correspond
to the elementary opposition of accented and unaccented phases.
In the same way a triplicated structure replaces the dipodic as the
acceleration still continues; and likewise of the dactylic forms.</p>

<p>We may say, then, that the relations of rate to complexity
of structure present the same fundamental phenomena in subjective
rhythmization and objectively determined types, the unit
of change only differing characteristically in the two cases.
The wider range of subjective adjustment in the latter over the
former experience is due to the increased positive incentive to a
rhythmical organic accompaniment afforded by the periodic reinforcement
of the objective stimulus.</p>

<p>An investigation of the limits of simple rhythmical groups is
not concerned with the solution of the question as to the extent
to which a reactor can carry the process of prolonging the series
of elements integrated through subordination to a single dominant
accentuation. The nature of such limits is not to be determined
by the introspective results of experiments in which the
observer has endeavored to hold together the largest possible
number of elements in a simple group. When such an attempt
is made a wholly artificial set of conditions, and presumably of
mechanisms, is introduced, which makes the experiment valueless
in solving the present problem. Both the direction and the
form of attention are adverse to the detection of rhythmical complications
under such conditions. Attention is directed away
from the observation of secondary accents and toward the realization
of a rhythm form having but two simple phases, the first
<span class="pagenum">[343]</span><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a>of which is composed of a single element, while within the latter
fall all the rest of the group. Such conditions are the worst
possible for the determination of the limits of simple rhythm
groups; for the observer is predisposed from the outset to regard
the whole group of elements lying within the second phase as
undifferentiated. Thus the conditions are such as to postpone
the recognition of secondary accents far beyond the point at
which they naturally arise.</p>

<p>But further, such an attempt to extend the numerical scope
of simple rhythm groups also tends to transform and disguise
the mechanism by which secondary stresses are produced, and
thereby to create the illusion of an extended simple series which
does not exist. For we have no right to assume that the process
of periodic accentuation in such a series, identical in
function though it be, involves always the same form of differentiation
in the rhythmical material. If the primary accentuation
be given through a finger reaction, the fixating of that
specific form of change will predispose toward an overlooking
of secondary emphases depending on minor motor reactions of
a different sort. The variety of such substitutional mechanisms
is very great, and includes variations in the local relations of the
finger reaction, movements of the head, eyes, jaws, throat,
tongue, etc., local strains produced by simultaneous innervation
of flexor and extensor muscles, counting processes, visual images,
and changes in ideal significance and relation of the various
members of the group. Any one of these may be seized
upon to mediate the synthesis of elements and thus become an
unperceived secondary accentuation.</p>

<p>Our problem is to determine at what point formal complication
of the rhythmical unit tends naturally to arise. How large
may such a group become and still remain fundamentally simple,
without reduplication of accentual or temporal differentiation?
The determination of such limits must be made on the basis of
quantitative comparison of the reactions which enter into larger
and smaller rhythmical series, on the one hand, and, on the
other, of the types of structure which appear in subjective
rhythmization and the apprehension of objective rhythms the
forms of which are antecedently unknown to the hearer. The
<span class="pagenum">[344]</span><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a>evidence from subjective rhythms is inconclusive. The prevailing
types are of two and three beats. Higher forms appear
which are introspectively simple, but introspection is absolutely
unable to solve the problem as to the possible composite nature
of these extended series. The fact that they are confined to
even numbers, the multiples of two, and to such odd-numbered
series as are multiples of three, without the appearance of the
higher primes, indicates the existence in all these groups of
secondary accentuation, and the resolution of their forms into
structures which are fundamentally complications of units of two
and three elements only. The process of positive accentuation
which appears in every higher rhythmical series, and underlying
its secondary changes exhibits the same reduction of their
elementary structure to double and triple groups, has been described
elsewhere in this report. Here it is in place to point out
certain indirect evidence of the same process of resolution as
manifested in the treatment of longer series of elements.</p>

<p>The breaking up of such series into subgroups may not be
an explicitly conscious process, while yet its presence is indispensable
in giving rhythmical form to the material. One indication
of such undiscriminated rhythmical modification is the
need of making or avoiding pauses between adjacent rhythmical
groups according as the number of their constituents varies.
Thus, in rhythms having units of five, seven, and nine beats
such a pause was imperative to preserve the rhythmical form,
and the attempt to eliminate it was followed by confusion in the
series; while in the case of rhythms having units of six, eight,
and ten beats such a pause was inadmissible. This is the consistent
report of the subjects engaged in the present investigation;
it is corroborated by the results of a quantitative comparison
of the intervals presented by the various series of reactions.
The values of the intervals separating adjacent groups for a
series of such higher rhythms are given in Table XX. as proportions
of those following the initial, accented reaction.<span class="pagenum">[345]</span><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a></p>

<p>The alternate rhythms of this series fall into two distinct
groups in virtue of the sharply contrasted values of their final
intervals or group pauses. The increased length of this interval
in the odd-numbered rhythms is unquestionably due to a subdivision
of the so-called unit into two parts, the first of which is
formally complete, while the latter is syncopated. In the case
of five-beat rhythms, this subdivision is into threes, the first
three of the five beats which compose the so-called unit forming
the primary subgroup, while the final two beats, together with
a pause functionally equivalent to an additional beat and interval,
make up the second, the system being such as is expressed
in the following notation: <img src="./images/360-music-1.png" width="147" height="40" alt="MUSIC" /> The pause at
the close of the group is indispensable, because on its presence
depends the maintenance of equivalence between the successive
three-groups. On the other hand, the introduction of a similar
pause at the close of a six-beat group is inadmissible, because
the subdivision is into three-beat groups, each of which is complete,
so that the addition of a final pause would utterly unbalance
the first and second members of the composite group,
which would then be represented by the following notation:
<img src="./images/360-music-2.png" width="161" height="40" alt="MUSIC" /> that is, a three-group would alternate
with a four-group, the elements of which present the same simple
time relations, and the rhythm, in consequence, would be
destroyed. The same conditions require or prevent the introduction
of a final pause in the case of the remaining rhythm
forms.</p>

<p>The progressive increase in the value of the final interval,
which will be observed in both the odd-and even-numbered
rhythms, is probably to be attributed to a gradual decline in the
integration of the successive groups into a well-defined rhythmical
sequence.</p>

<p>This subdivision of material into two simple phases penetrates
all rhythmical structuring. The fundamental fact in the
<span class="pagenum">[346]</span><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a>constitution of the rhythmical unit is the antithesis of two phases
which we call the accented and the unaccented. In the three-beat
group as in the two-beat, and in all more complex grouping,
the primary analysis of material is into these two phases.
The number of discriminable elements which enter each phase
depends on the whole constitution of the group, for this duality
of aspect is carried onward from its point of origin in the primary
rhythm group throughout the most complex combination
of elements, in which the accented phase may comprise an indefinitely
great number of simple elements, thus:
<img src="./images/361-music-1.png" width="265" height="40" alt="MUSIC" /> etc.
An indication of this process of differentiation into major and minor phases appears
in the form of rhythm groups containing upwards of four
elements. In these the tendency is, as one observer expresses it,
'to consider the first two beats as a group by themselves, with the
others trailing off in a monotonous row behind.' As the series
of elements thus bound up as a unit is extended, the number of
beats which are crowded into the primary subgroup also increases.
When the attempt was made to unite eleven or twelve
reactions in a single group, the first four beats were thus taken
together, with the rest trailing off as before. It is evident that the
lowest groups with which attention concerned itself here were
composed of four beats, and that the actual form of the (nominally)
unitary series of eleven beats was as follows:
<img src="./images/361-music-2.png" width="210" height="40" alt="MUSIC" /></p>


<p>The subscripts are added in the notation given above because
it is to be doubted if a strictly simple four-beat rhythm is ever
met with. Of the four types producible in such rhythm forms
by variation in the accentual position, three have been found, in
the course of the present investigation, to present a fundamental
dichotomy into units of two beats. Only one, that characterized
by secondary accentuation, has no such discriminable quality of
phases. Of this form two things are to be noted: first, that it
<span class="pagenum">[347]</span><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a>is unstable and tends constantly to revert to that with initial
stress, with consequent appearance of secondary accentuation;
and second, that as a permanent form it presents the relations
of a triple rhythm with a grace note prefixed.</p>

<p>The presence of this tendency to break up the four-rhythm
into subgroups of two beats explains a variety of peculiarities
in the records of this investigation. The four-beat rhythm with
final accent is found most pleasant at the close of a rhythmical
sequence. The possibility of including it in a continuous series
depends on having the final interval of 'just the right length.'
If one keeps in mind that a secondary initial accent characterizes
this rhythm form, the value required in this final interval
is explained by the resolution of the whole group into two units
of three beats each, the latter of the two being syncopated. The
pause is of 'just the right length' when it is functionally equal
to two unaccented elements with their succeeding intervals, as
follows: <img src="./images/362-music-1.png" width="106" height="30"  alt="MUSIC" title="" />.</p>

<p>Likewise in four-rhythms characterized by initial stress
there appears a tendency to accent the final beat of the group,
as well as that to accent the third. Such a series of four may
therefore break up in either of two ways, into <img src="./images/362-music-2.png" width="86" height="30"  alt="MUSIC" title="" />
on a basis of two-beat units, or into <img src="./images/362-music-3.png" width="112" height="30" alt="MUSIC" title="" />
on a basis of three-beat units.</p>

<p>The persistence of these simple equivalences appears also
in the treatment of syncopated measures and of supplementary
or displaced accents. Of the form <img src="./images/362-music-4.png" width="72" height="30" alt="MUSIC" title="" />
one reactor says,
and his description may stand for all, &quot;This deliberate introduction
of a third accent on the last beat is almost impossible
for me to keep. The single group is easy enough and rather
agreeable, but in a succession of groups the secondarily accented
third beat comes against the first of the next group with a very
disagreeable effect.&quot; This is the case where no pause intervenes
between the groups, in which case the rhythm is destroyed
by the suppression, in each alternate simple group, of the unaccented
phase; thus, <img src="./images/362-music-5.png" width="72" height="30" alt="MUSIC" title="" />
alone is pleasant, because it becomes<span class="pagenum">[348]</span><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a>
<img src="./images/363-music-1.png" width="85" height="30" alt="MUSIC" title="" />, but in combination with preceding and
succeeding groups it is disagreeable, because it becomes in reality
<img src="./images/363-music-2.png" width="84" height="30" alt="MUSIC" title="" />, etc. A long pause between the groups destroys
this disagreeableness, since the lacking phase of the second
subgroup is then restored and the rhythm follows its normal
course.</p>

<p>The amphibrachic form, <img src="./images/363-music-3.png" width="64" height="30" alt="MUSIC" title="" />, is more difficult to
maintain than either the dactylic or the trochaic, and in a continuous
series tends to pass over into one of these, usually
the former. 'With sufficient pause,' the reactors report, 'to
allow the attitude to die away,' it is easily got. The same inability
to maintain this form in consciousness appears when a continuous
series of clicks is given, every third of which is louder
than the rest. Even when the beginning of the series is made
coincident with the initial phase of the amphibrachic group the
rhythmic type slips over into the dactylic, in spite of effort. In
this, as in the preceding type of reaction, if the interval separating
adjacent groups be lengthened, the rhythm is maintained
without trouble. The 'dying away' of the attitude lies really
in such an arrangement of the intervals as will formally complete
a phrase made up of simple two-beat units.</p>

<p>The positive evidence which this investigation affords,
points to the existence of factors of composition in all rhythms
of more than three beats; and a variety of peculiarities which
the results present can be explained&mdash;and in my estimation explained
only&mdash;on the basis of such an assumption. I conclude,
therefore, that strictly stated the numerical limit of simple
rhythm groups is very soon reached; that only two rhythmical
units exist, of two and three beats respectively; that in all
longer series a resolution into factors of one of these types takes
place; and, finally, that the subordination of higher rhythmical
quantities of every grade involves these simple relations, of
which, as the scope of the synthesis increases, the opposition of
simple alternate phases tends more and more to predominate
over triplicated structures.</p>

<p>Variation in the number of elements which enter into the
<span class="pagenum">[349]</span><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a>rhythmic unit does not affect the sense of equivalence between
successive groups, so long as the numerical increase does not
reach a point at which it lessens the definiteness of the unit
itself. For the purpose of testing this relation the reactors beat
out a series of rhythm forms from 'one-beat' rhythms to those
in which the group consisted of seven, eight and nine elements,
and in which the units were either identical with one another or
were made up of alternately larger and smaller numbers of
elements. Two questions were to be answered in each case;
the manner in which these various changes affected the sense
of rhythmical equivalence in the alternate groups, and the
variations in affective quality which these changes introduced
into the experience. With the former of these problems we are
here concerned. From 'one-beat' to four-beat rhythms the
increase in number of constituents in no way affects the sense
of rhythmical equivalence. Beyond this point there is a distinct
falling off. 'The first part of the rhythm begins to fade
away before the end of the second,' says one; and another:
'The series then reverts to a monotonous succession without
feeling of rhythm.' This decline marks those groups composed
of an odd number of elements much earlier and more strongly
than those which contain an even number. The sense of
equivalence has fallen off at five and practically disappears at
seven beats, while groups of six and eight retain a fairly
definite value as units in a rhythmical sequence. This peculiar
relation must be due to the subconscious resolution of the larger
symmetrical groups into smaller units of three and four constituents
respectively.</p>

<p>Likewise the introduction of variations in the figure of the
group&mdash;that is, in the number of elements which enter into the
groups to be compared, the distribution of time values within
them, the position of accents, rests, and the like&mdash;does not in
any way affect the sense of equivalence between the unlike
units. Against a group of two, three, four, or even five elements
may be balanced a syncopated measure which contains but one
constituent, with the sense of full rhythmical equivalence in the
functional values of the two types. Indeed, in the case of five-beat
rhythms the definition of values is greater when such opposition
<span class="pagenum">[350]</span><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350"></a>finds place than when the five-beat group is continuously
repeated. This is to be explained doubtlessly by the more
definite integration into a higher rhythmical unity which is
afforded under the former conditions.</p>

<p>The number and the distribution of elements are factors variable
at will, and are so treated in both musical and poetical expression.
The condition which cannot be transgressed is the
maintenance of strict temporal relations in the succession of total
groups which constitute the rhythmical sequence. These relations
are, indeed, not invariable for either the single interval or
the duration of the whole group, but they are fixed functions of
the dynamic values of these elements and units. Two identically
figured groups (<i>e.g.</i>, <img src="./images/365-music-1.png" width="115" height="30" alt="MUSIC" title="" /> ),
no more possess
rhythmically substitutionary values than does the opposition of
a single beat to an extended series (<i>e.g.</i>, <img src="./images/365-music-2.png" width="93" height="30" alt="MUSIC" title="" /> ) ,
apart
from this factor of temporal proportion. Those groups which
are identical in figure must also be uniform in duration if they
are to enter as substitutionary groups into a rhythmical sequence.<a name="FNanchor_5_91" id="FNanchor_5_91"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_5_91'>5</a>
When the acatalectic type is alternately departed from and
returned to in the course of the rhythmical sequence, the metrical
equivalents must present total time-values which, while differing
from that of the full measure in direction and degree, in dependence
on the whole form of their structure, maintain similar fixed
relations to the primary type. The changes which these flexible
quantities undergo will here only be indicated. If the substitutionary
groups be of different figures, that which comprises the
larger number of elements will occupy the greater time, that
which contains fewer, the less.</p>

<p>I do not forget the work of other observers, such as Br&uuml;cke,
who finds that dactyls which appear among trochees are of less
duration than the latter, nor do I impugn their results. The
rhythmical measure cannot be treated as an isolated unit; it
must always be considered in its structural relations to the
<span class="pagenum">[351]</span><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a>rhythmical sequence of which it forms a part. Every non-conforming
measure is unquestionably affected by the prevailing
type of the rhythmical sequence in which it occurs. Br&uuml;cke
points out the converse fact that those trochees and iambs are
longest which appear in dactylic or other four-measures; but
this ignores the complexity of the conditions on which the character
of these intrusive types depends. The time-values of
such variants are also dependent on the numerical preponderance
of the typical form in the whole series. When a single
divergent form appears in the sequence the dynamic relations
of the two types is different from that which obtains when the
numbers of the two approach equality, and the effect of the
prevailing form on it is proportionally greater. Secondly, the
character of such variants is dependent on the subordinate configuration
of the sequence in which they appear, and on their
specific functions within such minor rhythmical figures. The
relative value of a single dactyl occurring in an iambic pentameter
line cannot be predicated of cases in which the two forms
alternate with each other throughout the verse. Not only does
each type here approximate the other, but each is affected by
its structural relation to the proximately higher group which the
two alternating measures compose. Thirdly, the quantitative
values of these varying forms is related to their logical significance
in the verse and the degree of accentuation which they
receive. Importance and emphasis increase the duration of the
measure; the lack of either shortens it. In this last factor, I
believe, lies the explanation of the extreme brevity of dactyls
appearing in three-rhythms. When a specific rhythm type is
departed from, for the purpose of giving emphasis to a logically
or metrically important measure, the change is characteristically
in the direction of syncopation. Such forms, as has been said
elsewhere, mark nodes of natural accentuation and emphasis.
Hence, the dactyl introduced into an iambic or trochaic verse,
which, so far as concerns mere number of elements, tends to
be extended, may, in virtue of its characteristic lack of accentuation
and significance, be contracted below the value of the
prevailing three-rhythm. Conversely the trochee introduced
into a dactylic sequence, in consequence of its natural accentuation
<span class="pagenum">[352]</span><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352"></a>or importance, may exceed in time-value the typical four-rhythm
forms among which it appears. The detailed examination
of the relation of temporal variations to numerical predominance
in the series, to subordinate structural organization,
and to logical accentuation, in our common rhythms, is a matter
of importance for the general investigation which remains still
to be carried out. In so far as the consideration of these factors
entered into the experimental work of the present research, such
quantitative time relations are given in the following table, the
two types in all cases occurring in simple alternation:</p>

<h5>TABLE XXI.</h5>

</table></div>

<p>As the disparity in numerical constitution increases, so will
also the divergence in time-value of the two groups concerned.
When differentiation into major and minor phases is present,
the duration of the former will be greater than that of the latter.
Hence, in consequence of the combination of these two factors&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>,
in a syncopated measure of unusual emphasis&mdash;the characteristic
time-values may be inverted, and the briefer duration
attach to that unit which comprises the greater number of elements.
Intensive values cannot take the place of temporal
values in rhythm; the time form is fundamental. Through all
variations its equivalences must be adhered to. Stress makes
rhythm only when its recurrence is at regular intervals. The
number of subordinate factors which combine with the accented
element to make the group is quite indifferent. But whether
few or many, or whether that element on which stress falls
stands alone (as it may), the total time values of the successive
groups must be sensibly equivalent. When a secondary element
is absent its place must be supplied by a rest of equivalent
<span class="pagenum">[353]</span><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"></a>time-value. If these proper temporal conditions be not observed
no device of intensive accentuation will avail to produce the
impression of metrical equivalence among the successive groups.</p>


<h4>B. <i>The Distribution of Elements Within the Group.</i></h4>

<p class="center">(<i>a</i>) The Distribution of Intensities.</p>

<p>In the analysis of the internal constitution of the rhythmic
unit, as in other parts of this work, the investigation follows two
distinct lines, involving the relations of rhythm as apprehended,
on the one hand, and the relations of rhythm as expressed, on
the other; the results in the two cases will be presented separately.
A word as to the method of presentation is necessary.
The fact that in connection with each experiment a group
of questions was answered gives rise to some difficulty in planning
the statement of results. It is a simple matter to describe
a particular set of experiments and to tell all the facts which
were learned from them; but it is not logical, since one observation
may have concerned the number of elements in the rhythmic
unit, another their internal distribution, and a third their
coalescence in a higher unity. On the other hand, the statement
of each of these in its own proper connection would necessitate
the repetition of some description, however meager, of the
conditions of experimentation in connection with each item.
For economy's sake, therefore, a compromise has been made
between reporting results according to distribution of material
and according to distribution of topics. The evidence of higher
grouping, for example, which is afforded by variations in duration
and phases of intensity in alternate measures, will be found
appended to the sections on these respective classes of material.</p>

<p>In all the following sections the hammer-clang apparatus
formed the mechanism of experimentation in sensory rhythms,
while in reactive rhythms simple finger-tapping was employed.</p>

<p>In comparing the variations in stress which the rhythmical
material presents, the average intensities of reaction for the
whole group has been computed, as well as the intensities of
the single reactions which compose it. This has been done
chiefly in view of the unstable intensive configuration of the
group and the small amount of material on which the figures
<span class="pagenum">[354]</span><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a>are based. The term is relative; in ascertaining the relations
of intensity among the several members of the group, at least
ten successive repetitions, and in a large part of the work fifty,
have been averaged. This is sufficient to give a clear preponderance
in the results to those characteristics which are really
permanent tendencies in the rhythmical expression. This is
especially true in virtue of the fact that throughout these experiments
the subject underwent preliminary training until the series
of reactions could be easily carried out, before any record of
the process was taken. But when such material is analyzed in
larger and smaller series of successive groups the number of
reactions on which each average is based becomes reduced by
one half, three quarters, and so on. In such a case the prevailing
intensive relations are liable to be interfered with and
transformed by the following factor of variation. When a
wrong intensity has accidentally been given to a particular reaction
there is observable a tendency to compensate the error by
increasing the intensity of the following reaction or reactions.
This indicates, perhaps, the presence of a sense of the intensive
value of the whole group as a unity, and an attempt to maintain
its proper relations unchanged, in spite of the failure to
make exact co&ouml;rdination among the components. But such a
process of compensation, the disappearance of which is to be
looked for in any long series, may transpose the relative values of
the accented elements in two adjacent groups when only a small
number of reactions is taken into account, and make that seem to
receive the major stress which should theoretically receive the
minor, and which, moreover, does actually receive such a minor
stress when the value of the whole group is regarded, and not
solely that member which receives the formal accentuation.</p>

<p>The quantitative analysis of intensive relations begins with
triple rhythms, since its original object was to compare the
relative stresses of the unaccented elements of the rhythmic
group. These values for the three forms separately are given
in Table XXII., in which the value of the accented element in
each case is represented by unity.<span class="pagenum">[355]</span><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a></p>

<h5>TABLE XXII.</h5>

</table></div>

<p>The dactylic form is characterized by a progressive decline
in intensity throughout the series of elements which constitute
the group. The rate of decrease, however, is not continuous.
There is a marked separation into two grades of intensity, the
element receiving accentual stress standing alone, those which
possess no accent falling together in a single natural group, as
shown in the following ratios: first interval to third, 1.000:0.349;
second interval to third, 1.000:0.879. One cannot
say, therefore, that in such a rhythmic form there are two
quantities present, an accented element and two undifferentiated
elements which are unaccented. For the average is not based
on a confused series of individual records, but is consistently
represented by three out of four subjects, the fourth reversing
the relations of the second and third elements, but approximating
more closely to equivalence than any other reactor (the proportional
values for this subject are 1.000; 0.443; 0.461). Moreover,
this reactor was the only musically trained subject of the
group, and one in whom the capacity for adhering to the logical
instructions of the experiment appears decidedly highest.</p>

<p>In the amphibrachic form the average again shows three
degrees of intensity, three out of four subjects conforming to
the same type, while the fourth reverses the relative values of
the first and third intervals. The initial element is the weakest
of the group, and the final of median intensity, the relation for
all subjects being in the ratio, 1.000:1.124. The amphibrachic
measure begins weakly and ends strongly, and thus approximates,
we may say, to the iambic type.</p>

<p>In the anap&aelig;stic form the three degrees of intensity are
still maintained, three out of four subjects giving consistent
results; and the order of relative values is the simple converse
of the dactylic. There is presented in each case a single
curve; the dactyl moves continuously away from an initial
accent in an unbroken decrescendo, the anap&aelig;st moves continuously
toward a final accent in an unbroken crescendo. But in
the anap&aelig;stic form as well as in the dactylic there is a clear
duality in the arrangement of elements within the group, since
<span class="pagenum">[356]</span><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a>the two unaccented beats fall, as before, into one natural group,
while the accented element is set apart by its widely differentiated
magnitude. The ratios follow: first interval to second,
1.000:1.009; first interval to third, 1.000:2.084.</p>

<p>The values of the three elements when considered irrespective
of accentual stress are as follows: First, 1.000; second,
1.001; third, 0.995. No characteristic preponderance due to
primacy of position appears as in the case of relative duration.
The maximum value is reached in the second element. This is
due to the co&ouml;peration of two factors, namely, the proximity of
the accentual stress, which in no case is separated from this
median position by an unaccented element, and the relative
difficulty in giving expression to amphibrachic rhythms. The
absolute values of the reactions in the three forms is of significance
in this connection. Their comparison is rendered possible
by the fact that no change in the apparatus was made in
the course of the experiments. They have the following values:
Dactylic, 10.25; amphibrachic, 12.84; anap&aelig;stic, 12.45. The
constant tendency, when any difficulty in co&ouml;rdination is met
with, is to increase the force of the reactions, in the endeavor
to control the formal relations of the successive beats. If such
a method of discriminating types be applied to the present
material, then the most easily co&ouml;rdinated&mdash;the most natural&mdash;form
is the dactyl; the anap&aelig;st stands next; the amphibrach is
the most unnatural and difficult to co&ouml;rdinate.</p>

<p>The same method of analysis was next applied to four-beat
rhythms. The proportional intensive values of the successive
reactions for the series of possible accentual positions are given in
the following table:</p>

<h5>TABLE XXIII.</h5>

<div class="center"><table border="0" width="60%" summary="TABLE XXIII">
<colgroup span="5"><col align="left" /><col span="4" align="right" /></colgroup>
<tr><th>Stress.</th><th>1st Beat.</th><th>2d Beat.</th><th>3d Beat.</th><th>4th Beat.</th></tr>
<tr><td>Initial,</td><td>1.000</td><td>0.575</td><td>0.407</td><td>0.432</td></tr>
<tr><td>Secondary,</td><td>0.530</td><td>1.000</td><td>0.546</td><td>0.439</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tertiary,</td><td>0.470</td><td>0.407</td><td>1.000</td><td>0.453</td></tr>
<tr><td>Final,</td><td>0.492</td><td>0.445</td><td>0.467</td><td>1.000</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>The first and fourth forms follow similar courses, each
marked by initial and final stress; but while this is true throughout
in the fourth form, it results in the first form from the preponderance
of the final interval in a single individual's record,
<span class="pagenum">[357]</span><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a>and therefore cannot be considered typical. The second and
third forms are preserved throughout the individual averages.
The second form shows a maximum from which the curve descends
continuously in either direction; in the third a division of
the whole group into pairs is presented, a minor initial accent
occurring symmetrically with the primary accent on the third
element. This division of the third form into subgroups appears
also in its duration aspect. Several inferences may be drawn
from this group of relations. The first and second forms only
are composed of singly accented groups; in the third and fourth
forms there is presented a double accent and hence a composite
grouping. This indicates that the position in which the accent
falls is an important element in the co&ouml;rdination of the rhythmical
unit. When the accent is initial, or occurs early in the
group, a larger number of elements can be held together in a
simple rhythmic structure than can be co&ouml;rdinated if the accent
be final or come late in the series. In this sense the initial position
of the accent is the natural one. The first two of these four-beat
forms are dactylic in structure, the former with a postscript
note added, the latter with a grace note prefixed. In the third
and fourth forms the difficulty in co&ouml;rdinating the unaccented initial
elements has resulted in the substitution of a dipodic division
for the anap&aelig;stic structure of triple rhythms with final accent.</p>

<p>The presence of a tendency toward initial accentuation appears
when the average intensities of the four reactions are
considered irrespective of accentual position. Their proportional
values are as follows: First, 1.000; second, 0.999; third,
1.005; fourth, 0.981. Underlying all changes in accentuation
there thus appears a resolution of the rhythmic structure into
units of two beats, which are primitively trochaic in form.</p>

<p>The influence exerted by the accented element on adjacent
members of the group is manifested in these forms more clearly
than heretofore when the values of the several elements are arranged
in order of their proximity to that accent and irrespective
of their positions in the group. Their proportional values are
as follows:</p>

<h5>TABLE XXIV.</h5>

<div class="center"><table border="0" cellspacing="5" summary="TABLE XXIV">
<colgroup span="5" align="right"></colgroup>
<tr><th>2d Remove.</th><th>1st Remove.</th><th>Accent.</th><th>1st Remove.</th><th>2d Remove.</th></tr>
<tr><td>0.442</td><td>0.526</td><td>1.000</td><td>0.514</td><td>0.442</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[358]</span><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a>This reinforcing influence is greater&mdash;according to the
figures just given&mdash;in the case of the element preceding the
accent than in that of the reaction which follows it. It may be,
therefore, that the position of maximal stress in the preceding
table is due to the close average relation in which the third position
stands to the accented element. This proximity it of course
shares with the second reaction of the group, but the underlying
trochaic tendency depreciates the value of the second reaction
while it exaggerates that of the third. This reception
of the primitive accent the third element of the group indeed
shares with the first, and one might on this basis alone have expected
the maximal value to be reached in the initial position,
were it not for the influence of the accentual stress on adjacent
members of the group, which affects the value of the third
reaction to an extent greater than the first, in the ratio 1.000:0.571.</p>

<p>The average intensity of the reactions in each of the four
forms&mdash;all subjects and positions combined&mdash;is worthy of note.</p>

<h5>TABLE XXV.</h5>

<div class="center"><table border="0" cellspacing="5" summary="TABLE XXV">

</table></div>

<p>The first and third forms, which involve initial accents&mdash;in
the relation of the secondary as well as primary accent to the
subgroups&mdash;are both of lower average value than the remaining
types, in which the accents are final, a relation which
indicates, on the assumption already made, a greater ease and
naturalness in the former types. Further, the second form,
which according to the subjective reports was found the most
difficult of the group to execute&mdash;in so far as difficulty may be
said to be inherent in forms of motor reaction which were all
relatively easy to manipulate&mdash;is that which presents the highest
intensive value of the whole series.</p>

<p>In the next group of experiments, the subject was required
to execute a series of reactions in groups of alternating content,
the first to contain two uniform beats, the second to consist of a
single reaction. This second beat with the interval following
it constitutes a measure which was to be made rhythmically
<span class="pagenum">[359]</span><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a>equivalent to the two-beat group with which it alternated. The
time-relations of the series were therefore left to the adjustment
of the reactor. The intensive relations were separated into two
groups; in the first the final reaction was to be kept uniform in
strength with those of the preceding group, in the second it was
to be accented.</p>

<p>The absolute and relative intensive values for the two forms
are given in the following table:</p>

<h5>TABLE XXVI.</h5>
<div class="center"><table border="0" width="80%" summary="TABLE XXV">
<colgroup span="5"><col align="left" /><col span="3" align="right" /><col align="left" /></colgroup>
<tr><th>Rhythm.</th><th>1st Beat.</th><th>2d Beat.</th><th>3d Beat.</th><th>Value.</th></tr>
<tr><td>Syncopated Measures</td><td>13.00</td><td>15.12</td><td>16.50</td><td>Absolute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Unaccented,</td><td>1.000</td><td>1.175</td><td>1.269</td><td>Relative.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Syncopated Measures</td><td>10.95</td><td>11.82</td><td>16.11</td><td>Absolute.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Accented,</td><td>1.000</td><td>1.079</td><td>1.471</td><td>Relative.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>These averages hold for every individual record, and therefore
represent a thoroughly established type. In both forms
the reaction of the syncopated measure receives the greatest
stress. In the first form, while the stress is relatively less
than in the second, it is at the same time absolutely greater.
The whole set of values is raised (the ratio of average intensities
in the two forms being 1.147:1.000), as it has
already been found to be raised in other forms difficult to
execute. To this cause the preponderance is undoubtedly to be
attributed, as the reports of every subject describe this form as
unnatural, in consequence of the restraint it imposes on an impulse
to accent the final reaction, <i>i.e.</i>, the syncopated measure.</p>

<p>In the next set of experiments the series of reactions involved
the alternation of a syncopated measure consisting of a single
beat with a full measure of three beats. The same discrimination
into accented and unaccented forms in the final measure
was made as in the preceding group. The series of absolute
and relative values are given in the following table.</p>

<h5>TABLE XXVII.</h5>

</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[360]</span><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360"></a>
These averages hold for every subject where the syncopated
measure receives accentuation, and for two out of three
reactors where it is unaccented. The latter individual variation
shows a progressive increase in intensity throughout the
series.</p>

<p>Here, as in the preceding forms, a well-established type is
presented. Not only when accentuation is consciously introduced,
but also when the attempt is made&mdash;and in so far as the
introspection of the reactor goes, successfully made&mdash;to maintain
a uniformity among the reactions of the full and syncopated
measures, the emphasis on the latter is unconsciously increased.
In the accented form, as before, there is a clear discrimination
into two grades of intensity (ratio of first three elements to final,
1.000:1.888) while in the unaccented no such broad separation
exists (ratio of first three elements to final, 1.000:1.156).</p>

<p>The type of succession in each of these forms of reaction is
a transformed dactylic, in which group should now be included
the simple four-beat rhythm with final accent, which was found
to follow the same curve. The group begins with a minor
stress in both of the present forms, this stress being greater in
the unaccented than in the accented type. This preponderance
I believe to be due to the endeavor to repress the natural accent
on the syncopated measure. In both forms the intensive value
of the second element is less than that of the third, while the
intensity of the initial reaction is greater than that of either of
these subsequent beats. This form of succession I have called
a <i>transformed dactylic</i>. It adheres to the dactylic type in possessing
initial accentuation; it departs from the normal dactylic
succession in inverting the values of the second and third members
of the group. This inversion is not inherent in the rhythmic
type. The series of three beats decreasing in intensity
represents the natural dactylic; the distortion actually presented
is the result of the proximity of each of these groups to
a syncopated measure which follows it. This influence I believe
to be reducible to more elementary terms. The syncopated
measure is used to mark the close of a logical sequence, or to
attract the hearer's attention to a striking thought. In both
cases it is introduced at significant points in the rhythmical
<span class="pagenum">[361]</span><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"></a>series and represents natural nodes of accentuation. The distortion
of adjacent measures is to be attributed to the increase
in this elementary factor of stress, rather than to the secondary
significance of the syncopation, for apart from any such
change in the rhythmical structure we have found that the reactions
adjacent to that which receives accentual stress are drawn
toward it and increased in relative intensity.</p>

<p>Further quantitative analysis of rhythmical sequences, involving
a comparison of the forms of successive measures
throughout the higher syntheses of verse, couplet and stanza,
will, I believe, confirm this conception of the mutable character
of the relations existing between the elements of the rhythmical
unit, and the dependence of their quantitative values on fixed
points and modes of structural change occurring within the
series. An unbroken sequence of dactyls we shall expect to
find composed of forms in which a progressive decrease of intensity
is presented from beginning to end of the series (unless
we should conceive the whole succession of elements in a verse
to take shape in dependence on the point of finality toward which
it is directed); and when, at any point, a syncopated measure is
introduced we shall look for a distortion of this natural form,
at least in the case of the immediately preceding measure, by an
inversion of the relative values of the second and third elements
of the group. This inversion will unquestionably be found to
affect the temporal as well as the intensive relations of the unit.
We should likewise expect the relations of accented and unaccented
elements in the two-beat rhythms to be similarly affected
by the occurrence of syncopated measures, and indeed to find
that their influence penetrates every order of rhythm and extends
to all degrees of synthesis.</p>

<p>To the quantitative analysis of the intensive relations presented
by beaten rhythms must be added the evidence afforded
by the apprehension of auditory types. When a series of sounds
temporally and qualitatively uniform was given by making and
breaking an electric circuit in connection with a telephone
receiver, the members of a group of six observers without exception
rhythmized the stimuli in groups&mdash;of two, three and four
elements according to rate of succession&mdash;having initial accentuation,
<span class="pagenum">[362]</span><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a>however frequently the series was repeated. When the
series of intervals was temporally differentiated so that every
alternate interval, in one case, and every third in another, stood
to the remaining interval or intervals in the ratio, 2:1, the
members of this same group as uniformly rhythmized the material
in measures having final accentuation. In triple groups the
amphibrachic form (in regard to temporal relations only, as no
accentuation was introduced) was never heard under natural
conditions. When the beginning of the series was made to
coincide with the initiation of an amphibrachic group, four of
those taking part in the investigation succeeded in maintaining
this form of apprehension for a time, all but one losing it in the
dactylic after a few repetitions; while the remaining two members
were unable to hold the amphibrachic form in consciousness
at all.</p>


<p class="center">(<i>b</i>) The Distribution of Durations.</p>

<p>The inquiry concerning this topic took the direction, first, of
a series of experiments on the influence which the introduction
of a louder sound into a series otherwise intensively uniform
exerts on the apparent form of the series within which it occurs.
Such a group of experiments forms the natural preliminary to
an investigation of the relation of accentuation to the form of
the rhythm group. The apparatus employed was the fourth in
the series already described. The sounds which composed the
series were six in number; of these, five were produced by the
fall of the hammer through a distance of 2/8 inch; the sixth,
louder sound, by a fall through 7/8 inch. In those cases in which
the intensity of this louder sound was itself varied there was
added a third height of fall of two inches. The succession of
sounds was given, in different experiments, at rates of 2.5, 2.2,
and 1.8 sec. for the whole series. The durations of the intervals
following and (in one or two cases) preceding the louder
sound were changed; all the others remained constant. A
longer interval intervened between the close and beginning of
the series than between pairs of successive sounds. After hearing
the series the subject reported the relations which appeared
to him to obtain among its successive elements. As a single
hearing very commonly produced but a confused impression, due
<span class="pagenum">[363]</span><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a>to what was reported as a condition of unpreparedness which
made it impossible for the hearer to form any distinct judgment
of such relations, and so defeated the object of the experiment,
the method adopted was to repeat each series before asking for
judgment. The first succession of sounds then formed both a
signal for the appearance of the second repetition and a reinforcement
of the apperception of its material.</p>

<p>In order to define the direction of attention on the part of
the observer it was made known that the factors to be compared
were the durations of the intervals adjacent to the louder sound
in relation to the remaining intervals of the series, and that all
other temporal and intensive values were maintained unchanged
from experiment to experiment. In no instance, on the other
hand, did any subject know the direction or nature of the variation
in those quantities concerning which he was to give judgment.
In all, five subjects shared in the investigation, C., E.,
F., H. and N. Of these C only had musical training. In the
tables and diagrams the interval preceding the louder sound is
indicated by the letter B, that following it by the letter A.
Totals&mdash;judgment or errors&mdash;are indicated by the letter T, and
errors by the letter E. The sign '+' indicates that the interval
against which it stands is judged to be greater than the remaining
intervals of the series, the sign '=' that it is judged equal,
and the sign '-' that it is judged less.</p>

<p>The first series of changes consisted in the introduction of
variations in the duration of the interval following the loud
sound, in the form of successive increments. This loud sound
was at the third position in the series. All intensive relations
and the duration of the interval preceding the louder sound
remained unchanged. The results of the experiment are presented
in the following table.</p>

The value of the interval following the louder sound is correctly
reported eight times out of thirty; that preceding it is
correctly reported sixteen times out of thirty. The influence
which such a change in intensive value introduced at a single
point in a series of sounds exerts on the apparent relation of its
adjacent intervals to those of the remainder of the series is not
equally distributed between that which precedes and that which
follows it, but affects the latter more frequently than the former
in a ratio (allowing latitude for future correction) of 2:1. In the
case of interval A the error is one of underestimation in twenty-seven
cases; in none is it an error of overestimation. In the
case of interval B the error is one of overestimation in seventeen
instances, of underestimation in two. The influence of the
introduction of such a louder sound, therefore, is to cause a decrease
in the apparent duration of the interval which follows it,
and an increase in that of the interval which precedes it. The
illusion is more pronounced and invariable in the case of the
interval following the louder sound than of that preceding it,
the proportion of such characteristic misinterpretations to the
whole number of judgments in the two cases being, for A, 77
per cent.; for B, 54 per cent. The effect on interval A is very
strong. In the second group, where the ratio of this interval
to the others of the series is 3:2, it is still judged to be equal
to these others in 50 per cent. of the cases, and less in 35 per
cent. Further, these figures do not give exhaustive expression
to the whole number of errors which may be represented in the
judgments recorded, since no account is taken of greater and
less but only of change of sign; and an interval might be underestimated
and still be reported greater than the remaining intervals
of the series in a group of experiments in which the
relation of the interval in question to these remaining intervals
ranged from the neighborhood of equivalent values to that in
which one was double the other. If in a rough way a quantitative
valuation of errors be introduced by making a transference
from any one sign to that adjacent to it (<i>e. g.</i>, - to =,
or = to +) equal to <i>one</i>, and that from one extreme sign to the
other equal to <i>two</i>, the difference in the influence exerted on the
two intervals will become still more evident, since the errors
<span class="pagenum">[365]</span><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a>will then have the total (quantitative) values of A 46, and B
19, or ratio of 1.000:0.413.</p>

<p>Next, the position of the louder sound in the series of six
was changed, all other conditions being maintained uniform
throughout the set of experiments. The series of intervals bore
the following relative values: A, 0.900; B, 1.100; all other
intervals, 1.000. The louder sound was produced by a fall of
0.875 inch; all others by a fall of 0.250 inch. The louder
sound occurred successively in the first, second, third, fourth
and fifth positions of the series. In the first of these forms it
must of course be remembered that no interval B exists. The
results of the experiment are shown in the following table:</p>

<p class="tblexp">Total judgments, 113; Errors (B = 31), A = 57.</p>


<p>The relatively meager results set forth in the preceding section
are corroborated in the present set of experiments. That
such a variation of intensity introduced into an otherwise undifferentiated
auditory series, while it affects the time-values of
both preceding and following intervals, has a much greater influence
on the latter than on the former, is as apparent here as in
the previous test. The number of errors, irrespective of extent,
for the two intervals are: B, 82.3 per cent, of total judgments;
A, 90.7 per cent. When the mean and extreme sign displacements
are estimated on the quantitative basis given above these
percentages become B, 64.5; A, 90.7, respectively&mdash;a ratio of
0.711:1.000.</p>

<p>The direction of error, likewise, is the same as in the preceding
section. Since the actual values of the two intervals
here are throughout of extreme sign&mdash;one always greater, the
other always less&mdash;only errors which lie in a single direction
<span class="pagenum">[366]</span><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366"></a>are discriminable. Illusions lying in this direction will be clearly
exhibited, since the differences of interval introduced are in every
case above the threshold of discrimination when the disturbing
element of variations in intensity has been removed and the
series of sounds made intensively uniform. In case of a tendency
to underestimate B or overestimate A, errors would not
be shown. This problem, however, is not to be met here, as
the results show; for there is recorded a proportion of 82.3 per
cent. of errors in judgment of interval B, and of 90.7 per cent.
in judgment of interval A, all the former being errors of overestimation,
all of the latter of underestimation.</p>

<p>The influence of position in the series on the effect exerted
by such a change of intensity in a single member can be stated
only tentatively. The number of experiments with the louder
sound in position five was smaller than in the other cases, and
the relation which there appears cannot be absolutely maintained.
It may be also that the number of intervals following that concerning
which judgment is to be given, and with which that
interval may be compared, has an influence on the accuracy of
the judgment made. If we abstract from this last set of results,
the tendency which appears is toward an increase in accuracy
of perception of comparative durations from the beginning to
the end of the series, a tendency which appears more markedly
in the relations of the interval preceding the louder sound than
in those of the interval which follows it. This conclusion is
based on the succession of values which the proportion of errors
to total judgments presents, as in the annexed table.</p>

<p>Next, the relation of the amount of increase in intensity introduced
at a single position in such a series to the amount of
error thereby occasioned in the apprehension of the adjacent
intervals was taken up. Two sets of experiments were carried
<span class="pagenum">[367]</span><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367"></a>out, in each of which five of the sounds were of equal intensity,
while one, occurring in the midst of the series, was louder; but
in one of the sets this louder sound was occasioned by a fall of
the hammer through a distance of 0.875 inch, while in the other
the distance traversed was 2.00 inches. In both cases the extent
of fall in the remaining hammers was uniformly 0.25 inch.
The results are given in the following table:</p>

<p class="tblexp">&sup1;Interval B in these experiments is of the same duration as all others but
that following the louder sound; hence, judgments in the second column are
correct.</p>

<p>Again the markedly greater influence of increased intensity
on the interval following than on that preceding it appears, the
percentage of errors being, for B (both intensities), 21.6 per
cent.; for A, 56.6 per cent. Also, in these latter experiments
the direction of error is more definite in the case of interval A
than in that of interval B.</p>

<p>The influence of changes in intensity on the amount of
error produced is striking. Two intensities only were used for
comparison, but the results of subsequent work in various other
aspects of the general investigation show that this correlation
holds for all ranges of intensities tested, and that the amount of
underestimation of the interval following a louder sound introduced
into an otherwise uniform series is a function of the
excess of the former over the latter. The law holds, but not
with equal rigor, of the interval preceding the louder sound.
So far as these records go, the influence of such an increase of
intensity is more marked in the case of interval B than in that
<span class="pagenum">[368]</span><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a>of interval A. It is to be noted, however, that the absolute
percentage of errors in the case of A is several times greater
than in that of B. I conclude that A is much more sensitive
than B to such influences, and that there is here presented, in
passing from intensity I. to intensity II., the rise of conditions
under which the influence of the louder sound on B is first distinctly
felt&mdash;that is, the appearance of a threshold&mdash;and that the
rate of change manifested might not hold for higher intensities.</p>

<p>Lastly, the rate at which the sounds of the series succeeded
one another was varied, in order to determine the relation
which the amount of influence exerted bore to the absolute value
of the intervals which it affected. Three rates were adopted,
the whole series of sounds occupying respectively 2.50 secs.,
2.20 secs, and 1.80 secs. The results are summed in the following
table:</p>

<p>The overestimation of the interval before the louder sound
also tends to increase in extent with the actual increase in duration
of the interval following that sound over the other intervals
of the series.</p>

<p>Thus, the form which the sensible time-relations of such a
limited series of sounds present is found to be intimately dependent
on the intensive preponderance of certain elements
within it, on the degree of increased stress which such elements
receive, on their local position in the series, and on the rate at
which the stimulations succeed one another. The knowledge
of these facts prepares us for the whole series of relations manifested
in the special quantitative investigations reported in the
sections which follow. In the first of these is presented the
time-relations obtaining among the successive reactions of the
various rhythm types discussed in the preceding division of this
part, the section, namely, on the distribution of intensities.</p>

<p>In the first group of reactions the series was not to be consciously
accented, nor to be divided into groups by the introduction
of pauses. The reactor was required only to conceive it
as a succession of two-beat groups continuously repeated, the
way in which the groups should be defined, whether by counting
or otherwise, being left to his own discretion. The experimental
group was composed of five subjects.<span class="pagenum">[370]</span><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a></p>

or on the part of individual reactors. In narrower ranges
the inconstancy of the periods is very marked, and their variations
of clearly defined rhythmical character. The duration of
the total measures of two beats is throughout alternately longer
and shorter, the average of their values presenting a ratio of
1.000:0.847. The order of this arrangement, namely, that the
longer period precedes the shorter in the larger group, is drawn
from the fact that measurements consistently began with the
initial reaction of the series.</p>

<p>An analysis of the constituent intervals of the unit group, as
shown in the second and third lines of the table, reveals the
existence of a complex subordinate rhythm. The two components
of the rhythmical group do not increase and decrease concomitantly
in temporal value in composing the alternate long
and short measures of the fluent rhythm. The movement involves
a double compensating rhythmical change, in which the
two elements are simultaneously in opposite phases to each other.
A measure which presents a major first interval contains always
a minor second; one introduced by a minor first concludes with
a major second. The ratios of these two series of periodic variations
must themselves manifestly be different. Their values
are, for the first interval of the measure, 1.000:1.214; and for
the second interval, 1.000:0.764. The greater rhythmical differentiation
marks the second of the two intervals; on the variations
of this second interval, therefore, depends the appearance
of that larger rhythm which characterizes the series. The
ratios of these primary intervals are less consistently maintained
than are those of the rhythmical measures built out of them. It
<span class="pagenum">[371]</span><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371"></a>will be noted that in both intervals there is a tendency for the
value of the difference between those of alternate groups to increase
as the tapping progresses. This change I have interpreted
as indicative of a progressive definition in the process of
rhythmization, depending on an increase in co&ouml;rdination and
differentiation of the reactions as the series advances.</p>

<p>A simple stress on alternate elements was next introduced
in the series, forming a simple trochaic measure repeated without
interruption. The quantitative results follow, arranged as
in the preceding experiment.</p>

<p>Here again there is no progressive acceleration or retardation.
The rhythmical differentiation of alternate measures is very
slight&mdash;the average ratio of the first to the second being 1.000:0.993&mdash;but
is of the same type as in the preceding. The excess
in the amount of this differentiation presented by the first
type of reaction over the second may be due to the presence of
a tendency to impart rhythmical character to such a series of
reactions, which, prohibited in one form&mdash;the intensive accent&mdash;finds
expression through the substitution for this of a temporal
form of differentiation.</p>

<p>In this trochaic rhythm the phases of variation in the constituent
intervals of the measure are concomitant, and their indices
of differentiation almost identical with each other. Their
values are, for the first, 1.000:0.979; and for the second, 1.000:0.995.
The higher index is that of the first interval, that,
namely, which follows the accented beat of the measure, and
indicates that the rhythmical change is due chiefly to a differentiation
in the element which receives the stress.</p>

<p>In iambic measures similarly beaten out there is likewise no
acceleration nor retardation apparent in the progress of the tapping.
The temporal differentiation of alternate measures is of
the same extent as in the preceding group, namely, 1.000:0.991.<span class="pagenum">[372]</span><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372"></a>

<p>The alternation of greater and less duration in the rhythm
groups is due to a variation in the time-value of the second interval
only, the index of average change in the first member being
zero. That is, the greater index of instability again attaches to
that element which receives the stress. Though this holds true
throughout these experiments, the amount of difference here is
misleading, since on account of the smaller absolute value of
the first interval the proportional amount of change within it
which passes unrecorded is greater than in the case of the
second interval.</p>

<p>In general, the larger temporal variations of the trochaic
and iambic rhythm forms are too slight to be significant when
taken individually. The evidence of rhythmical treatment in
such a series of reactions, which is strongly marked in the unaccented
form, nevertheless receives reinforcement from these
inconsiderable but harmonious results.</p>

<p>Since the progressive variation does not penetrate the whole
measure, but affects only a single constituent having a strongly
marked functional character, the process of change becomes
unlike that of true retardation. In such a case, if the increase
in duration be confined to a single element and parallel the
changes in a simultaneous variant of a different order, we
should regard them as functionally connected, and therefore
interpret the successively greater periods of time occupied by
the rhythmical measures as constituting no real slowing of the
tempo. The measure of relative tempo in such a case consists
in the ratios of the successive durations of the rhythmical units
<span class="pagenum">[374]</span><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374"></a>after the subtraction of that element of increase due to this extraneous
source. Here, since the increase is confined to that
member of the group which receives accentual stress, and
since the increase of accentuation is typically accompanied by
an extension of the following interval, the changes presented
do fulfil the conditions of a progressively increased accentuation
of the rhythm group, and to this origin I think it is undoubtedly
to be attributed. It is to be noted that the final interval also
undergoes a slight increase, while the median suffers a similarly
slight decrease in duration as the series progresses.</p>

<p>In the amphibrachic form the changes manifested by the
constituents of the unit group are more obscure. No progressive
retardation of the accented element is apparent. In the
initial and final intervals the difference in duration between the
first and last members of the series is small and appears early
in the process. If we assume the general application of the
laws of change presented in the preceding section, there should
be here two influences concerned in the determination of the
relations presented, the factors, namely, of position and accent.
The falling of the accentual stress on the median interval
eliminates one of the two factors of progressive reduction in
that element and replaces it by a factor of increase, thereby
doing away with the curve of change; while at the same time
it decreases the changes which occur in the bounding intervals
of the group by removing the accent from the first and by the
proximate position of its own accent tending to reduce the last
interval.</p>

<p>Under this same assumption there should be expected in the
anap&aelig;stic form of rhythm an exaggeration of the progressive
increase in the final interval, together with a further reduction
in the duration of the initial; since from the falling of the accent
on the final interval two factors of increase combine, while
in the initial, which immediately follows the accented interval
in the series, a positive factor of reduction appears. This is
actually the type of change presented by the quantitative relations,
which are given as proportional values in the following
table.<span class="pagenum">[375]</span><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375"></a></p>

slightly less than that of the previous rhythm from the

<p>The former table makes clear the predominance of the increase
in the accented element over the average of all unaccented
elements of the series; the latter shows the independence
of increase in the initial and final, and of decrease in the median
interval, of any relation to the position of the accentual stress.
Both the intensive accentuation and the demarcation of successive
groups thus appear to be factors of definition in the
rhythmic unit. Those types which are either marked by a
more forcible accent or separated by longer pauses are more
distinctly apprehended and more easily held together than
those in which the accent is weaker or the pause relatively
less. It would follow that the general set of changes which
these series of reactions present are factors of a process of
definition in the rhythmical treatment of the tapping, and are
not due to any progressive change in the elementary time relations
of the series.</p>

<p>The figures for measures of four beats are incomplete.
They show an increase in the average duration of the group
from first to last of the series in three out of the four forms,
namely, those having initial, secondary and final stress.</p>

<p>Of the relative amounts contributed by the several elements
to the total progressive variation of the measures in the first
form, the least marks those intervals which follow unaccented
beats, the greatest those which follow accented beats; among
the latter, that shows the greater increase which receives the
primary accent, that on which falls the secondary, subconscious
accent shows the less; and of the two subgroups which contain
these accents that in which the major accent occurs contributes
much more largely to the progressive change than does that
which contains the minor.</p>

<p>When the phases of accented and unaccented elements are
compared, irrespective of their position in the rhythmic group,
the same functional differences are found to exist as in the case
<span class="pagenum">[377]</span><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"></a>of triple rhythms. Their quantitative relations are given in the

<p>The cause of the apparent retardation lies, as before, in a
change occurring primarily in the accented elements of the

the results cited above, affects adjacent unaccented elements as
well, the whole constituting a process more naturally interpretable
as a functional accompaniment of progressive definition in
the rhythmical treatment of the material than as a mark of
primary temporal retardation.</p>

<p>A rhythmical alternation is here presented, the contributions
of the first and third elements being far in advance of those of
the second and fourth. The values of the minor pair are
almost equal; of the major the third exceeds the first. Under
the assumption already made this would indicate the existence
at these points of nodes of natural accentuation, of which the
second marks the maximum reached in the present series.</p>

<p>The determination of relative time-values for accented and unaccented
intervals was next sought by indirect experimentation,
in which the affective aspect of the experience was eliminated
from consideration, and account was taken only of the perception
of quantitative variations in the duration of the successive
intervals. Proceeding from the well-known observation that if
every alternate element of a temporally uniform auditory series
receive increased stress, the whole series will coalesce into successive
groups of two elements in which the louder sound precedes
<span class="pagenum">[378]</span><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378"></a>and the weaker follows, while the interval which succeeds
the unaccented sound, and which therefore separates adjacent
groups, will appear of greater duration than that which follows
the accented element, the investigation sought by employing
the method of right and wrong cases with a series of changing
time-values for the two intervals to determine the quantitative
proportion of the two durations necessary to produce the impression
of temporal uniformity in the series.</p>

<p>Two rhythm forms only were tested, the trochaic and dactylic,
since without an actual prolongation of considerable value
in the interval following the louder sound, at the outset, no apprehension
of the series as iambic or anap&aelig;stic could be brought
about. The stimuli were given by mechanism number 4, the
distance of fall being 2/8 and 7/8 inch respectively for unaccented
and accented sounds. The series of changes included extreme
proportional values of 0.714 and 1.769 in duration of the two
intervals. Six persons took part in the investigation. In the
following table is given the percentage of cases in which the
interval following the unaccented element was judged respectively
greater than, equal to, or less than that which followed
the accented element, for each of the series of ratios presented
by the time-values of the intervals in trochaic rhythm.</p>

<p>The anomalous percentage which appears in the first horizontal
row needs explanation. The limit of possible differentiation in
the time-values of accented and unaccented intervals in a
rhythmical group is characteristically manifested, not by the
rise of a perception of the greater duration of the interval following
the accented element, but through an inversion of the
<span class="pagenum">[379]</span><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379"></a>rhythmical figure, the original trochee disappearing and giving
place to an iambic form of grouping, the dactyl being replaced
by an anap&aelig;st. In the case in question the inversion had taken
place for all subjects but one, in whom the original trochaic
form, together with its typical distribution of intervals, remained
unchanged even with such a great actual disparity as is here
involved.</p>

<p>For this group of observers and for the series of intensities
taken account of in the present experiment, the distribution of
time-values necessary to support psychological uniformity lies
near to the ratio 1.400:1.000 for accented and unaccented
intervals respectively, since here the distribution of errors in
judgment is arranged symmetrically about the indifference
point. Overestimation of the interval following the louder
sound appears by no means invariable. Under conditions of
objective uniformity the judgment of equality was given in 38.4
per cent, of all cases. This cannot be baldly interpreted as a
persistence of the capacity for correct estimation of the time
values of the two intervals in the presence of an appreciation of
the series as a rhythmical group. The rhythmic integration of
the stimuli is weakest when the intervals separating them are
uniform, and since the question asked of the observer was invariably
as to the apparent relative duration of the two intervals,
it may well be conceived that the hearers lapsed from a rhythmical
apprehension of the stimuli in these cases, and regarded the
successive intervals in isolation from one another. The illusions
of judgment which appear in these experiences are essentially
dependent on an apprehension of the series of sounds in the
form of rhythmical groups. So long as that attitude obtains it
is absolutely impossible to make impartial comparison of the
duration of successive intervals. The group is a unit which
cannot be analyzed while it continues to be apprehended as part
of a rhythmical sequence. We should expect to find, were
observation possible, a solution of continuity in the rhythmical
apprehension in every case in which these distortions of the
normal rhythm form are forced on the attention. This solution
appears tardily. If the observer be required to estimate critically
the values of the successive intervals, the attention from the
<span class="pagenum">[380]</span><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380"></a>outset is turned away from the rhythmical grouping and directed
on each interval as it appears. When this attitude prevails very
small differences in duration are recognized (<i>e.g.</i>, those of
1.000:1.118, and 1.000:0.895). But when this is not the case,
the changes of relative duration, if not too great for the limits
of adaptation, are absorbed by the rhythmical formula and pass
unobserved, while variations which overstep these limits appear
in consciousness only as the emergence of a new rhythmic
figure. Such inversions are not wholly restricted by the necessity
of maintaining the coincidence of accentuation with objective
stress. With the relatively great differences involved in the
present set of experiments, the rhythmical forms which appeared
ignored often the objective accentuation of single groups and of
longer series. Thus, if the second interval of a dactyl were
lengthened the unaccented element which preceded it received
accentuation, while the actual stress on the first sound of the
group passed unobserved; and in a complex series of twelve
hammer-strokes the whole system of accentuation might be
transposed in the hearer's consciousness by variations in the
duration of certain intervals, or even by simple increase or decrease
in the rate of succession.<a name="FNanchor_6_92" id="FNanchor_6_92"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_6_92'>6</a></p>

<p>In the experiments on dactylic rhythm the changes introduced
affected the initial and final intervals only, the one
being diminished in proportion as the other was increased,
so that the total duration of the group remained constant.
The figures, arranged as in the preceding table, are given in
Table L.</p>

<p>The percentage given in the case of the highest ratio is
based on the reports of two subjects only, one of them the exceptional
observer commented on in connection with two-beat
rhythms; for all other participants the anap&aelig;stic form had
already replaced the dactylic. The distribution of values which
supports psychological uniformity in this rhythmic figure lies
between the ratios 1.166, 1.000, 0.800, and 1.250, 1.000, 0.755,
since in this region the proportion of errors in judgment on either
side becomes inverted. The two rhythmic forms, therefore,
<span class="pagenum">[381]</span><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381"></a>present no important differences<a name="FNanchor_7_93" id="FNanchor_7_93"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_7_93'>7</a> in the relations which support
psychological uniformity. A comparison in detail of the
distribution of judgments in the two cases reveals a higher percentage
of plus and minus, and a lower percentage of equality
judgments throughout the changes of relation in the dactylic
form than in the trochaic. This appears to indicate a greater
rhythmical integration in the former case than in the latter.
On the one hand, the illusion of isolation from adjacent groups
is greater at every point at which the intervening interval is
actually reduced below the value of either of the internal intervals
in the dactylic than in the trochaic rhythm; and on the
other, the sensitiveness to differences in the whole series is less
in the case of the trochee than in that of the dactyl, if we may
take the higher percentage of cases in which no discrimination
has been made in the former rhythm as a negative index of such
sensibility.</p>

<p>These figures are corroborative of the preceding conclusions.
The dactylic figure is maintained in the presence of much greater
<span class="pagenum">[382]</span><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382"></a>differences in the relative durations of accented and unaccented
intervals than is the trochaic. In the latter, inversions not only
appear earlier in the series, but become the (practically) exclusive
mode of apprehension at a point where not fifty per cent, of
the dactyls have suffered transformation. At a certain definite
stage in the process the tendencies toward the two forms of apprehension
balance each other, so that with the slightest change
in direction of attention the rhythmical figure inverts and reverts
to the original form indifferently. These points are defined, in
the case of the two rhythms here reported on, by the following (or
intermediate) ratios: Trochaic-Iambic, (1.400-1.571): 1.000;
Dactylic-Anap&aelig;stic, (1.666-2.000): 1.000.</p>

<p>The temporal conditions of such equilibrium are a strict
function of the degree of accentuation which the rhythm group
presents. The location of the indifference point must, therefore
be independently determined for each intensive value
through which the accented element may pass. Its changes are
given for five such increments in the following table, in which
the values of the various intervals are represented as proportions
of the absolute magnitudes which appear in the first, or
undifferentiated series.</p>

<h3>IV. THE COMBINATION OF RHYTHMICAL GROUPS IN HIGHER
SYNTHESES AND THEIR EQUIVALENCES.</h3>

<p>In the elaboration of higher rhythmical forms the combination
of formally identical groups is rather the rule than the exception,
since in poetical structures the definition of the metrical
form and the maintenance of its proper relations depend on a
clear preponderance of its own particular unit-type over local
variants. In the experimental investigation of composite
rhythm forms the temporal relations of structures presenting
such likeness in their constituent groups were first taken up.<span class="pagenum">[383]</span><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383"></a>
In the conduct of the research those differences of intensity
which are actually expressed and apprehended in the utterance
of a rhythmic sequence were uniformly employed. While
there is no doubt that a succession of perfectly identical forms
would, under the requisite temporal conditions, be apprehended
as presenting major and minor phases of accentuation, yet in
the expression of rhythmic relations the subordination of accents
is consistently observed, and all our ordinary apprehension of
rhythm, therefore, is supported by an objective configuration
which fulfils already the form of our own subjective interpretation.</p>

<p>The temporal relations of these major and minor phases
cannot be considered apart from the index of their respective
accentuations. As the distribution of elements within the
simple group fluctuates with the changes in intensive accentuation,
so does the form of temporal succession in larger structures
depend on the relations of intensity in their primary and
secondary accentuations. The quantitative values hereafter
given apply, therefore, only to those specific intensities involved
in the experiment. Two types were chosen, the trochee and
the dactyl. The series of sounds was given by successive
hammer-falls of 7/8 and 1/8 inch for the major, and 3/8 and 1/8 inch
for the minor phase. The distribution of time-values within
each group was made on the basis of previous experimentation
to determine those relations which support psychological uniformity.
These internal relations were maintained unchanged
throughout the series of ratios which the durations of the two
groups presented. Four subjects took part in the experiment.
The quantitative results in the composition of trochaic forms
are given in the following tables (LIII., LIV.), the figures of
which present, in the form of percentages of total judgments, the
apprehension of sensible equality or disparity in the two groups.</p>

<p>In the earlier set of experiments the series of ratios diverged
in both directions from unity; in the later it departed in one
only, since every divergence in the opposite direction had, in
the previous experiments, been remarked at once by the observer.
In this second set the series of differences is more
finely graded than in the former; otherwise the two sets of
<span class="pagenum">[384]</span><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384"></a>figures may be considered identical. Using the equilibrium of
errors as an index of sensible equality, the two trochaic groups
are perceptually uniform when the temporal ratio of major and
minor lies between 1.000:0.757 and 1.000:0.779.</p>

<p>As in the preceding case, when relations of equality obtained
between the two subgroups, the secondary period in
every instance appeared longer than the primary. This prolongation
was uniformly reported as displeasing. The distribution
of values which here support psychological uniformity lies
between 1.000:0.915 and 1.000:0.895, that is to say, the difference
of phases is less marked than in the case of the simpler
trochaic composite. This is a structural principle which penetrates
<span class="pagenum">[385]</span><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385"></a>all rhythmical forms. The difference in the case of both
of these composites is less than in the opposition of phases within
the simple group, in which for identical intensities and (practically)
the same group of observers these presented the ratio
1.000:0.714. It is evident that the relative differentiation of
accented and unaccented intervals due to specific variations in
intensity is greater than is that of successive groups characterized
by similar differences of accentual stress; and if still more
extensive groups were compared it would unquestionably be
found that a further approximation to equality had taken place.</p>

<p>In the integration of rhythmical groups this subordination of
the intensive accents which characterize them is not the sole
mechanism of higher synthesis with which we are presented.
Another mode is the antithesis of rhythmical quantities through
verse catalepsis. Such variation of the rhythmical figure can
take place in two directions and in two only: by an increase in
the number of constituents, giving what may be called <i>redundancy</i>
to the measure, and by a decrease in their number, or
<i>syncopation</i>. Each of these forms of departure from the typical
figure fulfils a specific rhythmic function which determines its
temporal and intensive characters, and its local position in the
rhythmical sequence.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Redundant Measures.</i>&mdash;The position of such a measure
is uniformly initial. On rare occasions individual observers
reported an inversion of this order in the earlier portion of the
series,<a name="FNanchor_8_94" id="FNanchor_8_94"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_8_94'>8</a> but in no case were subjectively formulated series concluded
in this way; and when the objective succession ended
with the redundant measure the experience was rhythmically
displeasing. In accentual stress the redundant measure is of
secondary rank, the chief intensity falling upon the shorter,
typical groups. Variation from the type does not, therefore,
unconditionally indicate a point of accentual stress, though the
two are commonly connected.</p>

<p>In regard to the relative duration of the redundant measure
the subjective reports indicate a large variability. The dactylic
form appears to be slightly longer than the trochaics
<span class="pagenum">[386]</span><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386"></a>among which it appears; but not infrequently it is shorter.<a name="FNanchor_9_95" id="FNanchor_9_95"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_9_95'>9</a>
These variations are probably connected with differences in
stress due to the relation which the measure bears to the accentual
initiation of the whole series; for this accent apparently
may fall either within the redundant measure itself or on the
first element of the succeeding group, thus: <img src="./images/401-music-1a.png" width="128" height="40" alt="MUSIC" title="" />, or
<img src="./images/401-music-1b.png" width="90" height="40" alt="MUSIC" title="" />.</p>

<p>Two rhythm forms were analyzed, the trochaic and the
dactylic, the series of sounds being given by hammer-falls of
7/8 and 1/8 inch for accented and unaccented elements respectively.
In each experiment full and syncopated measures alternated
regularly with each other in continuous succession, giving the
forms <img src="./images/401-music-2a.png" width="98" height="40" alt="MUSIC" title="" /> and
<img src="./images/401-music-2b.png" alt="MUSIC" width="141" height="40" title="" />.</p>

<p>The initiation of the series was in every case determined by chance. Six observers
took part in the work with trochaic forms, five in that with
dactylic. The quantitative results are given in the following
tables, in each of which the relations of duration, position and
stress are included.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[387]</span><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387"></a>The syncopated measure, like the redundant, bears to the
acatalectic group specific relations of duration, accentual stress,
and position in the rhythmical sequence. In position it is final.
This relation is independent of the factor of duration, on which
the order of elements in the simple measure depends. Even
the excessive shortening which occurs in the trochaic form,
when the full measure has a duration almost one and one half
times as great as the syncopated, brings about no inversion of
the order.</p>

<p>In duration the syncopated group is a shortened measure.
The amount of reduction necessary to preserve rhythmical proportion
with the rest of the sequence is greater in the trochaic
than in the dactylic form, as in the relation of accented to unaccented
elements in the simple measure it is greater than in
the case of the trochaic, a principle of structure which has
already been pointed out.</p>

<p>There is similar evidence in beaten rhythms to show that
when a full measure is elided, the pause which replaces it is of
less value than the duration of a syncopated measure. When
trochaic rhythms were beaten out with a distinct pause after
each measure, the relative values of the two intervals were
1.000:2.046. Such a pause cannot be equivalent to a suppressed
beat and its interval; I regard it as functionally equal
to a whole measure. If that value be allowed for the second
interval which it possesses in the same rhythm type when no
pause is introduced, namely, 1.000:0.920, the first two intervals
will have a value&mdash;in terms of linear measurement&mdash;of
1.93 + 1.77 or 3.70. The value of the suppressed measure
would therefore be 2.15, a ratio of acatalectic to elided group
of 1.000:0.581.</p>

<p>Iambic rhythm beaten out without separating pauses presents
the following ratio between first and second intervals, 1.000:1.054;
on the introduction of a pause between the measures the
ratio becomes 1.000:2.131. The assignment of these proportional
values gives 1.68 + 1.77, or 3.45, as the duration of
the first two intervals, and 1.81 for the pause, a ratio of 1.00:0.524.</p>

<p>In continuous dactylic tapping, the values of the successive
<span class="pagenum">[388]</span><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388"></a>intervals are 1.000; 0.756; 0.927; with a separating pause their
relations are 1.000; 0.692; 1.346. These being analyzed as
before, the elided measure will have the relative value of 0.419.
This shows a decline in the proportional duration of the elision
as the total value of the measure elided increases. There can
be little question that this principle applies also to the value of
elisions of higher rhythmic structures as well.</p>

<p>In intensity the syncopated measure is a point of increased
accentual stress. This relation is not constantly maintained in
the trochaic form, in which at one ratio the accent appears reduced;<a name="FNanchor_10_96" id="FNanchor_10_96"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_10_96'>10</a>
in the dactylic form divergences are all in the direction
of an apparent increase in accentuation. In rhythms beaten
out the form of succession was always prescribed (<i>e.g.</i>,
<img src="./images/403-music-1a.png" width="94" height="40" alt="MUSIC" title="" /> or
<img src="./images/403-music-1b.png" width="114" height="40" alt="MUSIC" title="" />
but not either at the subjects'
preference), so that no material was there afforded for a determination
of the primacy of particular figures; but the results
must of course show any tendency which exists toward an increased
accentuation of the syncopated measure. It needs but a
cursory reference to the statements of these results in Pt. III.,
B, of this paper, to observe how constant and pronounced this
tendency is.<a name="FNanchor_11_97" id="FNanchor_11_97"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_11_97'>11</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[389]</span><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389"></a>Conclusive evidence of the integration of simple rhythm
forms in higher structures is presented by the process of increasing
definition which every rhythmical sequence manifests between
its inception and its close. This process is manifested equally
in the facts of sensory apprehension and those of motor reproduction
of rhythm forms. On the one hand, there is a progressive
refinement in the discrimination of variations from temporal
uniformity as the series of stimulations advances; and correspondingly,
the sequence of motor reactions presents a clearly
marked increase in co&ouml;rdination taking place parallel with its
progress. A rhythmical form is thus given to the whole succession
of simple measures which are included within the limits
of the larger series, a form which is no less definite than that
exhibited by the intensive and temporal relations of the rhythmical
unit, and which, there can be little doubt, is even more
important than the latter in determining the character of the
rhythm experience as a whole.</p>

<p>The presentation of experimental results bearing on this
point will follow the lines already laid down. Only that part
of the material which is derived from the apprehension of sensory
rhythm forms can be applied to the determination of this
formal curve for the ordinary metrical types and their complications.
The facts of progressive co&ouml;rdination presented by
beaten rhythms are based on the repetition of simple forms only.
The completion of the evidence requires a quantitative analysis
of the temporal relations presented by the whole sequence of
integrated measures which compose the common verse forms:
dimeter, trimeter, etc. This matter was not taken up in the
present investigation.</p>

<p>The perception of variations in the measures of an iambic
pentameter line was first taken up. The series of sounds was
produced by the fall of hammer, the distances traversed being,
<span class="pagenum">[390]</span><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390"></a>for the accented elements 0.875 inch, and for the unaccented,
0.250 inch. The series was followed by a pause
equal to one and a half measures, and was repeated before
judgment was made. The time occupied by the series of sounds
was 2.62 seconds. The intervals between the successive sounds
were adjusted on the basis of previous experimentation concerning
the most acceptable relations between the durations of
accented and unaccented intervals. Their values were in the
ratio 1.000:0.714 for accented and unaccented respectively.
The variations were introduced in a single element, namely,
the interval following the accented beat of the group, which, in
this form of rhythm, is also the inter-group interval. This
interval was changed by successive increments of one seventh
its original value, or one twelfth the duration of the whole
measure. Four such additions were made, the final value of
the interval standing to its original duration in the ratio 1.000:0.636.
The same series of changes in the duration of the accented
interval was made successively in each measure of the
pentameter series. In all these experiments the subjects were
in ignorance of the character and position of the changes
introduced. The results appear in the annexed table.</p>

<p>In the five horizontal rows on the left of the table are set
down the number of times, out of a total of ten judgments, the
interval in question was perceived to be greater than the like
interval in other groups, under the original relation of uniformity
and for the four successive increments. On the right these
numbers are given as percentages of the whole number of judgments.
These figures show an increase of discriminative sensibility
for such changes as the series advances. The percentage
of correct discrimination, as it stands in the table, is the same
<span class="pagenum">[391]</span><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391"></a>for the first and second positions in the line, but this coincidence
is to be attributed to accident, in consequence of the relatively
small number of judgments on which the results are based,
rather than to a functional indifference in the two positions. I
conclude that fuller experiments would show a curve of continuous
increase in the number of correct judgments for the
whole series of measures here included. If we number the
series of ratios given above from one to five, the thresholds of
perceptible change for this series of positions, expressed in
terms of this numerical series, would be: I., 4.1; II., 4.1;
III., 3.9; IV., 3.6.</p>

<p>Secondly, in a series of five trochaic measures, the intervals
separating the groups&mdash;which in this case follow the unaccented
beat&mdash;were successively lengthened by increments identical
with those employed in the preceding set of experiments. The
results are presented in the table below, arranged similarly to
the previous one.</p>

<p>These results are essentially identical with those of the preceding
section. The sensitiveness to small differences in duration
within the rhythmical series becomes continuously greater
as that series proceeds. The thresholds of perceptible change
in terms of the numerical series of ratios (as in preceding paragraph)
are as follows: I., 4.0; II., 4.0; III., 3.7; IV., 3.6.</p>

<p>Finally, the intensity of the preceding sound was increased
as well as the duration of the interval separating it from the following
stroke. The measure employed was the trochaic, the
interval suffering change was that following the accented beat&mdash;in
this case, therefore, the intra-group interval. The relations
obtaining among the unchanged measures were, as to
duration of accented and unaccented elements, 1.000:0.714;
as to intensity, 0.875:0.250 inch. Instead of a series, as in
<span class="pagenum">[392]</span><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392"></a>the preceding experiments, only one change in each direction
was introduced, namely, an increase in duration of a single
accented element of the series from 1.000 to 1.285, and an
increase of the same element in intensity from 0.875 to 1.875
inch fall. The results are given in the annexed table:</p>

<p>The figures show that in regard to the discrimination of
changes in duration occurring in intervals internal to the rhythm
group, as well as in the case of intervals separating adjacent
groups, there is a progressive increase in sensibility to variations
as the succession of sounds advances. This increased sensitiveness
is here complicated with another element, the tendency
to underestimate the duration of the interval following a louder
sound introduced into a series. The influence of this second
factor cannot be analyzed in detail, since the amount of underestimation
is not recorded unless it be sufficient to displace the
sign of the interval; but if such a quantitative method be
applied as has already been described, the results show a continuous
decrease in the amount of underestimation of this interval
from the first position to the fourth, or penultimate, which
presents the following relative values: 92, 66, 50, 40. A
phase of rapid increase in the amount of underestimation appears
in the fifth or final position, represented on the above
scale of relative values by 120. This falling off at the end of
the series, which appeared also in previous experiments, can be
attributed only to an interference with the functions which the
several measures bear in the process of comparison, and indicates
that the accuracy of judgment is dependent on a comparison
of the measure or element in question with those which
follow as well as with those which precede it.<span class="pagenum">[393]</span><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393"></a></p>

<p>The results presented in the preceding section form the
statement of but one half the evidence of higher rhythmical
synthesis afforded by the material of the present investigation.
We turn now to the second set of results. It deals, in general,
with the quantitative relations of rhythmic forms which find expression
through finger reactions. Portions of this evidence
have already been presented, through motives of economy, in
connection with the discussion of the phases of differentiation in
intensity and duration which such beaten rhythms manifest.
The burden of it, however, is contained in the results of an
analysis, form by form, of the proportional mean variations
which characterize these types of rhythmic expression. This
method has been applied to a study (<i>a</i>) of the characters of the
constituent intervals of the unit, in their relation to accentuation
and position; (<i>b</i>) of the simple group which these elements compose;
and (<i>c</i>) of the forms of higher synthesis manifested by the
variations in successive groups. The first of these relations
concerns, indeed, only the internal organization of the simple
group, and has no direct bearing on the combination of such
groups in higher syntheses; but, again for the sake of economy,
the items are included with the rest of the material.</p>

<p>The application of such a method, as in all treatment of
material by mean variations, involves much labor,<a name="FNanchor_12_98" id="FNanchor_12_98"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_12_98'>12</a> and on that
account alone the lack of its employment to any considerable
extent in previous investigations may be excused; but to this
method, as it seems to me, must the final appeal be made, as
an indisputable means by which all questions concerning the
refined features of rhythmical organization, the definition of
units and the determination of the forms in which they enter
into larger rhythmic quantities, are to be settled.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum">[394]</span><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394"></a>Of all the possible forms of rhythmic apprehension or expression,
the material for such a statistical inquiry is most
readily obtainable in the form of a series of finger reactions, and
to such material the application of the method in the present investigation
has been restricted.</p>

<p>In the first experiment of this group the reactor was asked
to tap out a series in which temporal, but not intensive variations
were introduced; the strokes were to be of uniform strength but
separated into groups of two beats. No directions as to length
of pause between the successive groups were given, but the
whole form of the groups was to be kept absolutely constant.
The reports of the subjects were uniformly to the effect that no
accent had been introduced. At a cursory examination no intensive
grouping was apparent. These records were the earliest
analyzed, when only time relations were in mind, and no measurements
were made of variations in strength. Only the mean
variations of the intervals, therefore, will here be taken up.</p>

<p>A word first as to the relative value of the two intervals and
its significance. The form of a rhythmical series is determined
in every part by subordination to principles of strict temporal
arrangement. Every suppression of elements in such a series,
every rest and syncopated measure has as positive and well-defined
a function as have the successive reactions and their
normal intervals. If such a pause is made as we find introduced
in the present case, its value must be a fixed function of
the system of durations of which it forms a part, whether it
replace an element in a rhythmical unit, or a subgroup in a
higher rhythmical quantity. In general, the value of such
a rest is less than the duration of a corresponding full measure
or interval. For example, the syncopated forms
<img src="./images/409-music-1a.png" width="50" height="30" alt="MUSIC" title="" />
and <img src="./images/409-music-1b.png" width="66" height="30" alt="MUSIC" title="" />
are demonstrably of shorter average duration than the
corresponding measures<img src="./images/409-music-2a.png" width="45" height="30" alt="MUSIC" title="" />
and <img src="./images/409-music-2b.png" width="56" height="30" alt="MUSIC" title="" />;
and the pause
occurring at the close of a syncopated line&mdash;such as that in the
middle of a catalectic trochaic tetrameter&mdash;should be found of
less value than that of the regular foot.</p>

<p>In the present instance two reactions are made, a pause follows,
then the reactions take place again, and so on. The
<span class="pagenum">[395]</span><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395"></a>intervals separating successive groups of reactions thus result
from the coalescence of two periods, the interval which would
regularly follow the reaction and the additional pause at its
close. The value of the latter I interpret as functionally equivalent
to a group of two beats and not to a single interval; that
is, the rhythm beaten out is essentially quadruple, the second
member of each composite group being suppressed, as follows:
<img src="./images/410-music.png" width="87" height="35" alt="MUSIC" title="" />.</p>

<p>To estimate the proper value of such a rest the
average relative duration of first and second intervals was taken
in a continuous series of two-beat measures, in which the first
member was accented sufficiently to define the rhythmical
groups. The ratio was 1.000:0.760. In the present instance
the values of the simple initial interval and the composite interval
which follows it are, in terms of the linear measurement,
1.55 mm. and 3.96 mm. Assuming the above ratio to hold, the
duration of a period which included the second beat-interval and
a group-rest should be 1.16 + 1.55 + 1.16 = 3.87 mm. This
is slightly less than the actual value of the period, whereas it
should be greater. It must be remembered, however, that the
disparity between the two intervals increases with initial accentuation,
and in consequence the proportional amounts here added
for the second interval (1.16 to 1.55) should be greater. This
interval is not rhythmically 'dead' or insensitive. The index
of mean variation in all reactors is greater for the first than for
the second interval (or interval + pause) in the ratio 1.000:0.436,
that is, the value of the latter is more clearly defined
than that of the former, and the reactor doubly sensitive to
variations occurring within it.</p>

<p>An analysis of the variations of these intervals separately in
series of four groups reveals a secondary reciprocal rhythm, in
which the changes in value of the mean variation at any moment
are in opposite directions in the two intervals. These
values in percentages of the total duration of the periods are
given in the following table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[396]</span><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396"></a>Without measurement of their intensive values, interpretation
of these variations is speculative. They indicate that the pairs
of beats are combined in higher groups of four; that the differences
of mean variation in the first interval are functions of an
alternating major and minor accentuation, the former occurring
in the second and fourth, the latter in the first and third; and
that the inversely varying values of the mean variation in the
second interval are functions of the division into minor and major
groups, the reduced values of the second and fourth of these
intervals being characteristic of the greater sensitiveness to variations
occurring in the group pause than to changes occurring
within the group.</p>

<p>The fixity of the group is markedly greater than that of the
simple interval. In the one case in which the mean variation
of the group is greater than that of the elementary period the
material involved was meager (five instead of ten repetitions)
and the discrepancy therefore insignificant.</p>

<p>The difference in the mean variation of the first and second
intervals respectively rises to an individual maximum of 3.000:1.000,
and averages for all subjects 2.290:1.000; the fixity,
that is to say, of the inter-group interval in this form of tapping
is more than twice as great as that of the intra-group interval.
The fixity of the larger rhythmical quantities is greater than that
of the smaller, whether the relation be between the elementary
interval and the unit group, or between the synthetic unit and
its higher composite. The average mean variation of the beat
intervals exceeds that of the whole group in the relation of
1.953:1.000. The differentiation of larger and smaller groups
is less clear. When the material is taken in groups of eight
successive beats the mean variation is less in the case of every
subject than when taken in fours, in the ratio 1.000:1.521.
The comparative values for groups of two and four beats is
reversed in two thirds of the cases, yet so that an average for
all subjects gives the ratio 1.000:1.066 between groups of four
and two beats. The whole series of values arranged on the
basis of unity for the mean variation of the beat interval is
given in Table LXII.<span class="pagenum">[397]</span><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397"></a></p>

<p>The persons taking part in the investigation were next required
to make a series of reactions composed of unit groups of
two beats, in each of which the first member received accentuation,
a simple trochaic rhythm. In this type the relation of
intra-group to inter-group interval remains unchanged. In all
subjects but one the mean variation of the first interval exceeds
that of the second in the average ratio 1.722:1.000. The
amount of difference is less than in the preceding type of reaction.
In the former there is presented not an intensively uniform
series, but an irregularly rhythmical grouping of intensities,
in dependence on the well-defined parallel types of temporal
differentiation; in the latter such intensive differentiation is
fundamental and constant in its form. Assuming the character
of the second interval to remain unchanged, there is in the intensive
fixity of the initial accented element, on the one hand,
and the alternate assertion of the impulse to accentuation and
repression of it in the attempt to preserve uniformity, on the
other, an occasion for the difference in the relation of the mean
variation of this interval to that of the following in the two cases.
It is to be expected that there should be less irregularity in a
series of reactions each of which represents an attempt to produce
a definite and constant rhythmical accent, than in a series
in which such an accent is spasmodically given and repressed.</p>

<p>For a like reason, the difference in value between the mean
variations of the elementary interval and the unit group should
be less in the case of the positive rhythm form than in that of
a series which combines a definite temporal segregation with
an attempt to maintain intensive uniformity. The mean variation
of the interval is still of greater value than that of the unit
group, but stands to it in the reduced ratio 1.000:0.969.</p>

<p>The relations of higher groups present certain departures
from the preceding type. In three cases out of five the unit has a
greater fixity than its immediate compound
<img src="./images/412-music.png" width="110" height="40" alt="MUSIC" title="" />, with
an average ratio of 0.969:1.072. The original relation, however,
<span class="pagenum">[398]</span><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398"></a>is re&euml;stablished in the case of the next higher multiple,
the eight-beat group, the whole series of values, arranged on
the basis of unity for the simple interval, being as follows:</p>

<h5>TABLE LXIII.</h5>

</table></div>

<p>An analysis of the material in successive pairs of two-beat
groups revealed a pronounced rhythm in the values of the mean
variations of the first and second members of the pair respectively,
the fixity of the second group being much greater than
that of the first, the mean variation having a ratio for all subjects
of 0.801:1.000. The interpretation of this rhythmical
variation, as in the preceding reaction series, must be speculative
in the absence of quantitative measurement of intensive
changes, but is still not left in doubt. The rhythmic material
is combined in larger syntheses than the groups of two beats,
alternately accented and unaccented, which were avowedly in
mind. This secondary grouping appears in at least a measure
of four beats, into which the unit group enters as the elementary
interval entered into the composition of that unit. In this
larger group the initial period, or element of stress, is characterized
by a greater mean variation than the unaccented period
which follows it. There are present in this first interval two
factors of instability: the factor of accent, that element which
receives the stress, being in general characterized by a greater
mean variation than the unaccented; and the factor of position,
the initial member of a rhythmical group, independent of accentuation,
being marked by a like excess of mean variation over
those which follow it. The interpretation of the latter fact lies
in the direction of a development of uniformity in the motor
habit, which is partially interrupted and re&euml;stablished with the
ending and beginning of each successive group, large or small,
in the series of reactions.</p>

<p>Further, when the material is arranged with four unit groups
in each series, the same relation is found to hold between the
first period composed of two unit groups and the second like
period, as obtained within these pairs themselves. The mean
<span class="pagenum">[399]</span><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399"></a>variation of the first period of four beats is greater than that of
the second in the case of all subjects but one, with an average
ratio for all subjects of 1.000:0.745. The analysis was not
carried further; there is, however, nothing which points to a
limitation of the process of synthesis to groups of this magnitude;
rather, to judge from the close approximation in definition
of the two orders manifested here, there is suggested the
probability that it is carried into still higher groupings.</p>

<p>In the next rhythmical type analyzed&mdash;the iambic form&mdash;that
relation of the first to the second interval holds which was
found to obtain in the preceding forms. The excess of mean
variation in the former over the latter presents the ratio 1.274:
1.000. In amount it is less than in either of the previous types
(2.290:1.000 and 1.722:1.000). For here, though both elements
have constant relations as accented or unaccented members
of the group, the factor of stress has been transferred from
the initial to the final beat. Instead, therefore, of combining in
a single member, the factors of inconstancy due to stress and to
position are distributed between the two elements, and tend to
neutralize each other. That the preponderance of irregularity
is still with the initial interval leads to the inference that position
is a greater factor of inconstancy than accentuation.</p>

<p>Also, the group presents here, as in the preceding forms, a
greater fixity than does the individual interval. This relation
holds for all subjects but one, the average mean variations of
the simple interval and of the unit group having the ratio 1.000:0.824.</p>

<p>In larger groupings irregularities in the relations of higher
and lower again occur, and again the greater constancy obtains
between the first and second orders of higher grouping (in
which for only one subject has the lower group a greater fixity
than the higher, and the averages for all subjects in the two
cases are in the ratio 1.149:0.951), and the lesser constancy
between the unit group and the first higher (in which two subjects
manifested like relations with those just given, while three
present inverted relations). The whole series of relations, on
the basis of unity for the mean variation of the simple interval,
is given in Table LXIV.<span class="pagenum">[400]</span><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400"></a></p>

<p>There is also presented here, as in the preceding forms, a
synthesis of the material into groups of four and eight beats,
with similar differences in the fixity of the first and last periods
in each. A single subject, in the case of each order of grouping,
diverges from the type. The ratio of difference in the
mean variations of the first and second members of the groups
is, for series of four beats, 1.000:0.657, and for series of eight
beats, 1.000:0.770. This indicates a diminishing definition of
rhythmical quantities as the synthesis proceeds, but a diminution
which follows too gradual a curve to indicate the disappearance
of synthesis at the proximate step in the process.</p>

<p>Three-beat rhythms were next taken up and the same method
of analysis carried out in connection with each of the three
accentual forms, initial, median, and final stress. In these
types of rhythm the intra-group intervals are more than one in
number; for the purpose of comparison with the final, or inter-group
interval, the average of the first and second intervals has
been taken in each case.</p>

<p>The results agree with those of the preceding types. The
mean variation of the interval separating the groups is less
throughout than that of the average group-interval. The ratios
for the various rhythm types are as follows:</p>

<h5>TABLE LXV.</h5>


<div class="center"><table width="70%" summary="TABLE LXV">
<colgroup span="4"><col align="left" /><col span="3" align="center" /></colgroup>
<tr><th>Rhythm Form.</th><th>Initial Stress.</th><th>Median Stress.</th><th>Final Stress.</th></tr>
<tr><td>Ratios,</td><td>1.000 : 0.758</td><td>1.000 : 0.527</td><td>1.000 : 0.658</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This relation, true of the average intra-group interval, is
also true of each interval separately. Among these ratios the
greatest departure from unity appears in the second form which
all subjects found most difficult to reproduce, and in which the
tendency to revert to the first form constantly reasserts itself.
The difference in value of the mean variations is least in the
first form, that with initial accent, and of intermediate magnitude
in the third form when the accent is final. The contrary
might be expected, since in the first form&mdash;as in the second
<span class="pagenum">[401]</span><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401"></a>also&mdash;the factors of stress and initial position are both represented
in the average of the first two intervals, while in the
third form the factor of stress affects the final interval and
should, on the assumption already made concerning its significance
as a disturbing element, tend to increase the mean variation
of that interval, and, therefore, to reduce to its lowest
degree the index of difference between the two phases. That
it does so tend is evident from a comparison of the proportional
mean variations of this interval in the three forms, which are in
order: initial stress, 4.65 per cent.; median stress, 4.70 per
cent., and final stress, 7.15 per cent. That the consequent
reduction also follows is shown by the individual records, of
which, out of four, three give an average value for this relation,
in forms having final stress, of 1.000:0.968, the least of
the group of three; while the fourth subject departs from this
type in having the mean variation of the initial interval very
great, while that of the final interval is reduced to zero.</p>

<p>If, as has been assumed, the magnitude of the average
mean variation may be taken as an index of the fixity or definition
of the rhythm form, the first of these three types, the
ordinary dactylic is the most clearly defined; the second, or
amphibrachic, stands next, and the third, the anap&aelig;stic, has least
fixity; for in regard to the final interval, to the average of the
first and second and also to each of these earlier intervals
separately, the amount of mean variation increases in the order
of the accents as follows:</p>

<p>In these triple rhythms, as in the two-beat forms, the simple
interval is more variable than the unit group, and the lower group
likewise more unstable than the higher. The series of proportional
values for the three forms is given in the table annexed:</p>

</table></div>


<p><span class="pagenum">[402]</span><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402"></a>A comparison of the second and third columns of the table
shows an excess of mean variation of the smaller group over
that of the larger in each of the three forms. It is true also of
the individual subjects except in two instances, in each of which
the two indices are equal. This proportion is broken in the
relation of the primary interval to the unit group in the dactylic
rhythm form. A similar diversity of the individual records
occurred in the two-beat rhythms.</p>

<p>The same indication of higher groupings appears here as in
the case of previous rhythms. Rhythmical variations are presented
in the amount of the mean variations for alternate groups
of three beats. Chronologically in the records, as well as in
dependence on theoretical interpretation, the first member of each
higher group is characterized by the greater instability. The
amounts of this difference in co&ouml;rdination between the first and
last halves in series of six beats is set down for the three rhythm
forms in the following table:</p>

<h5>TABLE LXVIII.</h5>

<div class="center"><table cellspacing="3" width="50%" summary="TABLE LXVI">
<colgroup span="3"><col align="left" /><col span="2" align="center" /></colgroup>

<tr><td>Median,</td><td>1.000</td><td>0.668</td></tr>
<tr><td>Final,</td><td>1.000</td><td>0.770</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p class="tblexp"> ¹These figures are made up from the records of three out of
four subjects. In the exceptional results of the fourth subject no mean variation appears in the first half and 6.3
per cent, in the second, making the average for the whole group 1.000:1.023.</p>

<p>There is still other evidence of higher rhythmical grouping
than these oscillations in the amount of the mean variation of
alternate groups. Exactness of co&ouml;rdination between the individual
intervals of successive groups might undergo development
without affecting the relative uniformity of such total groups
themselves. But, throughout these results, an increase in co&ouml;rdination
between the periods of the whole group takes place
in passing from the first to the second member of a composite
group. The relation here is not, however, so uniform as in the
preceding case. The series of proportional values is given on

    the results of the same reactor as in the preceding cases
    being discarded. Including this, the ratio becomes
    1.000:1.016.</p>


<p>The index of mean variation for the individual elements of
the group also shows a progressive decrease from first to last as
follows:</p>

<h5>TABLE LXX.</h5>

<div class="center"><table width="65%" summary="TABLE LXX">

<tr><td>Final,</td><td>11.95</td><td>&quot;</td><td>9.77</td><td>&quot;</td><td>7.15</td><td>&quot;</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The relation holds in all cases except that of I. to II. in the
rhythm with initial stress. From this table may be gathered
the predominance of primacy of position as a factor of disturbance
over that of stress. Indeed, in this group of reactions the
index of variation for the accented element, all forms combined,
falls below that of the unaccented in the ratio 6.95 per cent.:7.91 per cent.</p>

<p>In rhythms of four beats, as in those of three, the estimation
of values is made on the basis of an average of the mean variations
for the three intra-group intervals, which is then compared
with the final or inter-group interval. As in those previous forms,
sensitiveness to variations in duration is greater throughout in
the case of the latter than in that of the former. The proportional
values of their several mean variations are given in the
annexed table:</p>

<h5>TABLE LXXI.</h5>

<div class="center"><table cellspacing="5" summary="TABLE LXXI">
<colgroup span="5"><col align="left" /><col align="right" span="4" /></colgroup>

<tr><td>Inter-group,</td><td>0.941</td><td>0.775</td><td>0.725</td><td>0.713</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This relation, true of the average of all intra-group intervals,
is not, as in the preceding forms, true of each of the three
constituent intervals in every case. In the second and fourth
forms, those marked by secondary and final stress, it holds for
<span class="pagenum">[404]</span><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404"></a>each member of the group of intervals; in the first form it fails
for the second and third intervals, while in the third form it
fails for the last of the three.</p>

<p>The proportional amount of this difference in mean variation
continuously increases from beginning to end of the series of
rhythmical forms. This cannot be interpreted as directly indicative
of a corresponding change in the definition which the
four forms possess. The absolute values of the several mean
variations must simultaneously be taken into account. First,
then, in regard to the final pause there is presented the following
series of values:</p>

<h5>TABLE LXXII.</h5>

<div class="center"><table cellspacing="5" summary="TABLE LXXI">

<tr><td>M.V.</td><td>6.57 per cent.</td><td>9.50 per cent.</td><td>4.90 per cent.</td><td>15.70 per cent.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>A very striking rhythmical alternation in the magnitude of
the mean variation thus occurs according as the accents fall on
the first member of the subgroups when its amount is smaller
or on the second member when it is larger. Further, the cases
noted above, the second and fourth forms, in which each of the
intra-group intervals is severally of greater mean variation than
the final pause, are just those in which the index of mean variation
in the final pause itself is at a maximum.</p>

<p>The average mean variations of the earlier intervals thus
present changes which are analogous to and synchronous with
those of the final pause. Their values in proportion to the
whole duration of the intervals are as follows<a name="FNanchor_15_101" id="FNanchor_15_101"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_15_101'>13</a>:</p>

<p>Those rhythmical forms having their accentual stress initial,
or on the initial elements of the subgroups, are marked by a
sensitiveness almost twice as great as those in which the stress
is final, or on the final elements of the subgroups.</p>

<p>Finally, if we take the whole series of intervals severally,
we shall find that this rhythmical variation holds true of each
<span class="pagenum">[405]</span><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405"></a>element individually as it does of their average. The whole
series of values is given in the table annexed.</p>

<p>It is an obvious inference from these facts that the position
of the accent in a rhythmical group is of very great significance
in relation to the character of the rhythmical movement. The
initial accent gives incomparably greater co&ouml;rdination and perfection
to the forms of uttered (produced) rhythm than does the
final. It is in this sense the natural position of the accent, because
on the success and fluency of this co&ouml;rdination the &aelig;sthetic
value of the rhythm depends.</p>

<p>In general, though not so unequivocally, the four-beat
rhythms show a progressive increase of stability in passing
from the simple interval to the group, and from the smaller
group to the larger. The series of values for the four accentual
positions follows.</p>

<p>Here, as in the preceding rhythmical forms, the most constant
relation is that of smaller and larger groups, in which no
exception occurs to the excess of mean variation in the former
over the latter. The cases in which this relation is reversed are
found, as before, in comparing the simple interval with the duration
of the unit group; and the exceptional instances are just
those, namely the first and third forms, in which the mean
variation of this uncompounded interval is itself at a minimum.
This means that the simple interval presents a more mobile character
than that of the group; and while in general it is less stable
<span class="pagenum">[406]</span><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406"></a>than the latter, it is also the first to show the influence of increased
co&ouml;rdination. Training affects more readily the single
element than the composite measure, and in the most highly co&ouml;rdinated
forms of rhythm the simple interval is itself the most
perfectly integrated unit in the system of reactions.</p>

<p>Here, as in the preceding rhythmical forms, evidence of
higher grouping appears in the alternate increase and decrease
of mean variation as we pass from the first to the second subgroup
when the material is arranged in series of eight beats.
The proportional values of the indices are given in the following

<p>The first member of the larger group, in the case of every
rhythm form here in question, is less exactly co&ouml;rdinated than
the second, the interpretation of which fact need not here be
repeated. Several additional points, however, are to be noted.
The differences in stability of co&ouml;rdination which are encountered
as one passes from the first to the last of the four rhythm forms,
extends, when the reactions are analyzed in series of eight beats,
to both members of the compound group, but not in equal ratios.
The mean variation of the second and fourth forms is greater,
both in the first and second subgroups, than that of the corresponding
subgroups of the first and third forms; but this increase
is greatest in the first member of the composite group. That is,
as the group grows more unstable it does so mainly through an
increase in variation of its initial member; or, in other words,
the difference in variability of the beat intervals of the first and
last subgroups reaches its maximum in those rhythmic types in
which the indices of mean variation for these intervals are themselves
at their maxima.</p>

<p>This process of co&ouml;rdination, with its indication of a higher
rhythmical synthesis, appears also in the transformations in the
value of the mean variations in duration of the total groups,
when the material is treated in series of eight beats, as in table
LXXVII.<span class="pagenum">[407]</span><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407"></a></p>

<p>The total initial group, therefore, as well as each of its constituent
intervals, is less stable than the second.</p>

<p>Within the unit group itself the values of the mean variation
show here, as in the preceding forms, a progressive increase in
sensitiveness to temporal variations from first to last of the component
intervals. The proportional values for the four intervals
in order are, 1.000, 0.786, 0.771, 0.666. The distribution
of these relative values, however, is not uniform for all four
rhythmical forms, but falls into two separate types in dependence
on the position of the accents as initial or final, following the discrimination
already made. The figures for the four forms separately
are as follows:</p>

<p>In the first type (Rhythms I. and III.) appear a descending
curve followed by an ascending; in the second type (Rhythms
II. and IV.) a second descending curve follows the first. The
changes in the first type are not co&ouml;rdinated with a similar curve
of variation in the intensive magnitude of the beats. It is to be
noted here that the smallest mean variation presented in this
whole set of results is found in that element of the first form
which receives the stress, an exception to the general rule.
The variations in the contrasted type have their maxima at those
points on which the group initiation&mdash;primary or secondary&mdash;falls,
namely, the first and third.</p>

<p>As in preceding rhythmical forms, while the separation of
accentual stress from primacy in the series tends to increase the
mean variation of that element on which this stress falls and to
raise the index of mean variation for the whole group, yet the
mean variation of the initial element is also raised, and to a still
<span class="pagenum">[408]</span><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408"></a>greater degree, reinforcing the evidence that primacy of position
is a more important factor of instability than the introduction of
accentual stress.</p>

<p>In the investigation of mean variations for units (if we may
call them such) of more than four beats only a modicum of material
has been worked up, since the types of relation already
discovered are of too definite a character to leave any doubt as
to their significance in the expression of rhythm. The results
of these further experiments confirm the conclusions of the
earlier experiments at every point.</p>

<p>These higher series were treated in two ways. In the first
the reactor beat out a rhythm consisting in the simple succession
of groups of reactions, each of which contained one and only
one accent. These units in each case were marked by initial
stress, and were composed of five, six, seven, eight and ten
beats respectively. The results are given in the following
table, which contains the series of mean variations in duration
both for single intervals and for total groups.</p>

<p>The averages for the combined, median, unaccented intervals
are given separately from those of the final interval, for
the reason that the mean variation of the latter is greater in
three cases out of five than that of the former, a relation which
apparently contradicts what has already been said concerning
the sensitiveness to variations which marks the intervals separating
rhythmical groups. The reason for this final increase in
variation appears when the relative intensities of the series of
reactions are considered. They are given in Table LXXX.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[409]</span><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409"></a>In every case the final element is marked by an increase
over that which precedes it (see last two columns of table) of
the average value for all rhythms of 1.000:0.900; an increase
which raises it above the average value of the whole series of
preceding unaccented beats in three cases out of five. To this
final accentuation the increase in variation is to be attributed.
Yet despite the additional element of disturbance due to this
increased final stress the average value of the mean variation for
this final interval is lower than that of the median unaccented
intervals in the ratio (all rhythms combined) of 0.992 : 1.000.</p>

<p>Turning, then, to Table LXXIX., there is presented, firstly,
an excess of variation in the accented element over that of the
average unaccented elements in every case but one (the six-beat
rhythm in which the values are nearly identical), which for the
whole series of rhythms has a value of 1.000:0.794. Secondly,
in every completed case (part of the figures in the last rhythm
are inadvertently lacking), the average mean variation of the
single interval preponderates over that of the total group.</p>

<p>The second form of rhythmical tapping, in which the longer
series were beaten out as pairs of equal subgroups, was added in
order to determine the quantitative relations of the mean variations
for alternate subgroups when such groups were purposely
intended, instead of appearing in the form of unconscious modifications
of the rhythmical treatment, as heretofore. At the
same time the results present an additional set of figures embodying
the relations here in question. They are as follows:</p>

<p>No exception here occurs to the characteristic predominance
in instability of the accented element. As regards simple intervals,
the relation of first and second groups is reversed, the
<span class="pagenum">[410]</span><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410"></a>reason for which I do not know. It may be connected with the
rapid speed at which the series of reactions was made, and its
consequent raising of the threshold of perceptible variation,
proportional to the value of the whole interval, to which is also
due the higher absolute value of the variations which appear in
both tables.</p>

<p>These inversions disappear when we compare the relative
stability of the first and second subgroups, in which the excess
of variation in the former over the latter is not only constant
but great, presenting the ratio for all three rhythms of 1.000:0.816.
The characteristic relation of lower to higher rhythmical
syntheses also is here preserved in regard to the two subgroups
and the total which they compose.</p>

<p>The points here determined are but a few of the problems
regarding the structure of larger rhythmical sequences which
are pressing for examination. Of those proximate to the matter
here under consideration, the material for an analysis of the
mean variation in intensity of a series of rhythmical reactions is
contained in the measurements taken in the course of the present
work, and this may at a future time be presented. The
temporal variations having once been established it becomes a
minor point.</p>

<p>Such conclusions, however, are only preliminary to an investigation
of the characteristic structure of the ordinary metrical
forms, and to these attention should next be turned. The
configuration of the common meters should be worked out both
in relation to the whole formal sequence, and to the occurrence
within the series of characteristic variations. There can be no
question that each metrical structure, the iambic trimeter or
dactylic tetrameter line, for example, composes a definite rhythmical
melody within which each measure is shortened or prolonged,
subdued or emphasized, according to its position and
connections in the series of relations which constitute the rhythmical
sequence.</p>

<p>These several metrical forms should be explored and the
characters of each measure in the series quantitatively determined.
Such an investigation would include an ascertainment
of the proportional time-value of each successive measure, its
<span class="pagenum">[411]</span><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411"></a>average force, and its sensitiveness to variations, temporal and
intensive. It should include an examination of the configuration
of the single measure and the changes in distribution of
accents and intervals which it undergoes as the rhythmical
series advances. For the rhythm group must not be conceived
as a simple unchanging form; both intensively and temporally
it is moulded by its function in the whole sequence, the earlier
iambic of a heroic measure being unlike the later, the dactyl
which precedes a measure of finality different from that which
introduces the series. Such a set of determinations will give
the pure characteristic curves of our common poetical meters.</p>

<p>But these meters are no more simple forms than are their
constituent measures. At every point their structure is subject
to modification by factors which appear in the rhythmic utterance
in virtue of its use as a medium for the free expression of
thought and emotion; and the manner in which the characteristic
form is altered by these factors of variation must be studied.
Of these variations the more important are the effects of the introduction
of variants&mdash;of spondees among dactyls, of anap&aelig;sts
among iambics, and the like&mdash;and the occurrence of points of
origin, emphasis, interruption, and finality in special accentuations,
syncopated measures, c&aelig;sural pauses and elisions. These
factors influence the structure both of those measures within
which they appear and of those adjacent to them. The nature
and extent of this wave of disturbance and its relation to the
configuration of the whole sequence call for examination.</p>

<p>Finally, this process of investigation should be applied to
the larger structures of the couplet and stanza, that the characteristic
differences in the pair or series of verses involved
may be determined. These characters include the whole time
occupied by each verse of the stanza, the relative values of
acatalectic and catalectic verses occurring within the same
stanza structure, differences in rhythmical melody between the
latter forms, the variations of average intensity in the accentual
elements of such lines, and a determination of the values of
rests of higher and lower degrees&mdash;mid-line, verse, and couplet
pauses&mdash;which appear in the various stanza forms, and their
relation to other structural elements.</p>

<h2><a name="AES2" id="AES2"></a>RHYTHM AND RHYME.</h2>

<h4>BY R.H. STETSON.</h4>


<h3>I. INTRODUCTION.</h3>


<p>The psychological theory of rhythm has its beginnings in the
work of Herbart,<a name="FNanchor_1_102" id="FNanchor_1_102"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_1_102'>1</a> who inaugurated the treatment of rhythm as
a species of time perception and suggested an explanation of its
emotional effects. While Herbart had simply pointed out the
effect of a whole rhythmic series in giving rise to an emotion
of expectation, delay, or haste, Lotze<a name="FNanchor_2_103" id="FNanchor_2_103"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_2_103'>2</a> applied the principle
severally to each unit group (each foot) in the rhythm, and
made the emotional effect of rhythm depend on these alternate
feelings of strain, expectation, and satisfaction produced by
every repetition of the unit group. Vierordt<a name="FNanchor_3_104" id="FNanchor_3_104"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_3_104'>3</a> did the first experimental
work on rhythm, determining the period of greatest
regularity in the tapping of rhythms. But the first important
experiments were carried on by von Br&uuml;cke.<a name="FNanchor_4_105" id="FNanchor_4_105"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_4_105'>4</a> By tapping out
rhythms on a kymograph, he determined the well-known
'Taktgleichheit' of the feet in scanned verse, and noted a number
of facts about the time relations of the different unit groups.
Mach<a name="FNanchor_5_106" id="FNanchor_5_106"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_5_106'>5</a> added to the previous knowledge about rhythm certain
observations on the subjective accentuation of an objectively
uniform series, and specially he noted that the process is
involuntary. With a much clearer understanding of the facts
of rhythm than his predecessors had had, he really provided the
<span class="pagenum">[414]</span><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414"></a>foundation for the theories which follow. His most important
contribution, for some time overlooked, was his emphasis of the
essentially motor nature of the phenomena of rhythm, and his
motor theory therefor.</p>

<p>Many of the recent theories of rhythm are based on Wundt's
analysis. The work of Wundt and Dietze,<a name="FNanchor_6_107" id="FNanchor_6_107"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_6_107'>6</a> was concerned
with rhythmic series; but it may be noted that the 'span of
consciousness' and the 'synthetic activity of consciousness'
were the subjects actually under investigation. Rhythm was
considered as a special temporal form of this 'psychic synthesis.'
There are three different elements in a sound series,
declared these writers, which contribute to this synthesis: qualitative
changes, intensive changes and melodic changes. Of
these the intensive changes are the most important. Every increase
in intensity, that is, every beat ('Hebung') is followed
by a decrease, and the next increase which follows is recognized
as a repetition of the preceding beat and as the forerunner
of the beat which is to follow. From this comes the synthetic
power of the rhythm. Just as the simple unit groups are
built up by this synthesizing power, so they in turn are combined
into larger phrases and periods. The motor factor has
little place in Wundt's own discussion,<a name="FNanchor_7_108" id="FNanchor_7_108"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_7_108'>7</a> the 'mental activity' is
the all-important thing. Bolton<a name="FNanchor_8_109" id="FNanchor_8_109"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_8_109'>8</a> also made a very important
contribution to the experimental knowledge of rhythm. His
work was based entirely on Wundt's theory. His method of
experimentation was accurate and his observations copious.
The arrangement of his apparatus, however, led him to emphasize
objective uniformity as a condition of rhythmic grouping;
so that Meumann's criticism of his application of this principle
to poetry is quite just. Nevertheless Bolton established the
essential facts of subjective accentuation and apparent temporal
displacement. It is noteworthy that he laid great emphasis on
the motor aspect of rhythm, and made many careful observations
on the 'motor accompaniment.' While inclining strongly
<span class="pagenum">[415]</span><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415"></a>to a motor interpretation he did not attempt to cut loose from the
Wundtian 'apperceptive process' as the primary factor.</p>

<p>The most elaborate consideration of rhythm yet published
is that of Meumann.<a name="FNanchor_9_110" id="FNanchor_9_110"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_9_110'>9</a> He avowedly worked out and defended
the theory of Wundt. The only important difference is the
larger place which he gave to the 'motor accompaniment,' although
he was always careful to emphasize its secondary and
derived character. He insisted that the 'mental activity' is always
primary, and that without it there can be no rhythmization;
and he opposed vigorously the motor inclinations of Mach and
Bolton. It is certainly unfortunate that rhythm has always
fallen into the hands of the investigators of the 'attention,' or
the 'span of consciousness,' or the 'perception of time.' It is
but an incident that judgments of time are often based on
rhythms; and everything that Meumann has said of a 'mental
prius,' or a 'synthesizing activity' in the case of rhythms, may
just as well be said in the case of any co&ouml;rdinated act.</p>

<p>Meumann discussed in detail the characteristics of the
rhythm of a simple series of sounds, of music, and of verse.
He assumed that in the simple sound series we have rhythm in
its barest form, and only the rhythmic synthetic activity is at
work; while in music there is a content which to some extent
prescribes unities, and the objective regularity of the rhythm is
broken. In verse we have much more content, and the rhythmization
is no longer regular in its temporal relations; it is entirely
dominated at times by the 'logical unities' of the 'thought.'</p>

<p>One great difficulty with such a differentiation of the three
types of rhythms presents itself when one inquires into the objective
regularity of the types; the fact is that music is by far
the most regular in its time values, though it has more content
than the sound series; and that just as great irregularities are
possible in the bare sound series as in the rhythm of verse with
its rich and definite content.</p>

<p>Later statements of the facts and theories relating to rhythm
have inclined more and more to an emphasis of the motor
aspect, even on the part of Wundtians. Since Meumann there
has been some detailed laboratory work published, but the
<span class="pagenum">[416]</span><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416"></a>amount of accurately measured rhythmic material is astonishingly
small. Meumann established experimentally the well-known
relation between the length of a rhythmic element and
its accent, and corroborated the earlier work on subjective
accentuation. The reports contain the measurements of but about
eighty individual unit groups (iambs, trochees, etc.). Ebhardt<a name="FNanchor_10_111" id="FNanchor_10_111"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_10_111'>10</a>
gave the measurements of from 150 to 300 taps from each of
three subjects. But his work is vitiated, as far as any application
to rhythm is concerned, because he based everything on
the judgment of <i>equality</i>, which has nothing to do with rhythm.</p>


<p>Hurst, McKay and Pringle<a name="FNanchor_11_112" id="FNanchor_11_112"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_11_112'>11</a> published measurements of
about 600 individual unit groups from three different subjects;
in several cases, the material consists rather too much of records
of the experimenters themselves, but in general their results
agree very well with those of other authors. Scripture<a name="FNanchor_12_113" id="FNanchor_12_113"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_12_113'>12</a> published
the measurements of a single stanza of poetry. It is but
a single stanza and quite too little material on which to base
any conclusions, but it is notable as a measurement of freely
spoken rhythm. No experiments have been published which
bear on the nature of the rhythmic phrase, of the period, or of
the stanza.</p>

<p>Our problem is: What part do the recurrent qualitative factors,
like rhyme, play in the grouping of rhythms? They
function evidently, in the main, as factors determining the
periods or larger phrases of the rhythm structure&mdash;the verses
and stanzas of poetry and nonsense verse. As no work has
been done on the nature of such larger rhythmic unities, a large
share of the investigation was concerned with the nature of the
verse unity.</p>

<p>Two methods of investigation were used: Subjects listened
to rhythmic series, into which various modifications were introduced;
and secondly, rhythms of a prescribed type, produced
by the subject, were recorded and measured.</p>

<h3>II. THE PERCEPTION OF A RHYTHMIC SERIES.</h3>

<p>Apparatus: A disc (Fig. 1, Plate IX.) about 50 c. in diameter,
rotating on a vertical pivot, was driven by a pulley-cone
underneath mounted on the same spindle (not shown in the
figure). On the face of the disc were four concentric rings of
regularly spaced holes, which received pegs of uniform height
and provided with a shoulder. Corresponding holes of each
circle lay on the same radius. On a plate supported by a
bracket were mounted four levers whose heads stood in line
radially to the movable disc. When the disc rotated to the
right under the levers, the pegs forced up the lever heads
and made an electric contact. The dip of the levers was controlled
by a screw adjustment. The apparatus was driven by a
motor and reducing gear, which were isolated in a sound-proof
box. The rate of speed was controllable.</p>

<p>The apparatus was built for use with sounders connected
with the binding-posts, but in this investigation sounders were
dispensed with, and the clicks from the apparatus itself were
used, since but one qualitative difference was introduced. As a
rule, the objective accent of the foot was not given; the subjective
accentuation was nearly always sufficient. Subjects
were quite unable to say whether the accent was objective or
not. If necessary, an accentuation was produced by raising the
pegs representing the accentuated part of the foot. The group
elements were represented by single, simple clicks made by a
brass screw on the lever arm striking an iron plate (the noise
of the brass peg striking the lever head was eliminated by
damping with cloth). The rhyme was represented by a compound
noise consisting of a click higher in pitch than the verse
element click, made by the peg striking the lever head, and an
almost simultaneous click lower in pitch than the verse element
click, made by the screw of the lever arm striking another iron
plate. The rhyme noise was not louder than the verse element
click, and as a whole gave the impression of being a lower
tone because the first click was very brief. Subjects did not
analyze the rhyme noise, and had no difficulty in making it
<span class="pagenum">[418]</span><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418"></a>represent rhyming syllables. The pauses throughout had no
filling.</p>

<p>The subject was always given a normal series until the type
was clearly established, and when the variations to be judged
were introduced his attention was directed as far as possible to
the factor to be introduced. This seemed the only way to
obtain trustworthy judgments. If the subject waits blindly for
some perceptual change in the whole complicated mass of sensations
which the simplest rhythmic series constitutes, he is apt
to fit his attention on some irrelevant detail, and the change
may not be noted until greatly exaggerated, and he may not
judge that particular factor at all.</p>

<p>The subject was always asked to choose a rate of delivery
which would correspond to his natural rate of reading nonsense
verse, and the clicks were always associated with syllables,
though not with words. An effort was made to keep the series
as colorless and devoid of content as possible, to eliminate uncertain
association. Beyond suppressed articulation, the subject
was not encouraged to mark the rhythm with any part of
the body, but a number of involuntary movements of neck,
body, hand, or foot were nearly always observed. Occasionally,
when a subject's expression was doubtful, he was asked
to say a nonsense series with the clicks.</p>

<p>The nomenclature to be used in this paper is that of meter,
but it is always subject to the reservation that the material is
only analogous to series of nonsense syllables.</p>

<p>Records were kept in terms of the intervals on the revolving
disc; the time of revolution was also taken, so that the figures
may be translated in time intervals if desired. Thus, 34, 34, 34,
34, 34 represents a series of iambs in which the unaccented
click has the length of three, and the accented click the length
of four spaces between pegs. A uniform verse represented
by a digit giving the number of feet, followed by digits in parenthesis
giving the character of the foot, <i>e.g.</i>, 4 (34), is an
iambic tetrameter.</p>

<p>For convenience, the verse pause is written independently of
the last foot of the verse, <i>e.g.</i>, 4 (34) p. 7 represents a tetrameter
<span class="pagenum">[419]</span><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419"></a>line having the intervals 34, 34, 34, 37. The interval
of the last accented syllable is counted twice.</p>

<p>Occasionally this is disregarded and vs. p. equals o is written
to indicate that the vs. p. is equal to the foot pause.</p>

<p>The results of the experiments may be grouped under three
heads:</p>

<p>1. Why does a synthesizing factor such as rhyme occur at
the end of the verse?</p>

<p>2. What is the relation between the verse pause and the
rhyme?</p>

<p>3. What is the relation of rhyme to the cyclic movement of
the unit group and of the verse?</p>


<h4><i>1. Why the Synthesizing Factor Occurs at the Close of the
Verse.</i></h4>

<p>To determine a possible difference in the sense of rhythm at
the beginning and the close of a verse, pauses ('lags') were
introduced into the earlier and later parts of the verse. These
pauses were made barely perceptible, <i>i.e.</i>, barely perceptible
in any part of the verse. Usually in iambic verse the barely perceptible
lag shows the following proportions to the other pauses:</p>

<p class="center">34 <i>35</i> 34 etc., or<br />
47 <i>48.5</i> 47.</p>

<p>Most of the experiments were performed with iambic tetrameter.
The subject was told to note the lags in the verse:
these were introduced either in both parts of the verse or at its
close only. At least three verses were given, and records were
kept of the false judgments. When lags of identical duration
were introduced between the first and second and between the
third and fourth feet, it was found that nearly always the lag
would not be detected in the earlier part of the verse but would
be detected in the later part. Out of eighty-two cases, there
were but six in which the same lag was recognized in the first
as well as in the last position. In two of these cases the subject's
attention had been called to the first part of the verse;
and in the four other cases the lag was still found more marked
at the close than at the beginning.<span class="pagenum">[420]</span><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420"></a></p>

<p>There were no cases in which a lag detected in the earlier
part of the verse was not also detected in the later part. False
judgments, when they occurred, were made as to a lag in the
earlier part of the verse. One subject falsely located a lag in
the first of the verse four times. Judgments as to the earlier
part of the verse were uncertain and frequently changed.</p>

<p>The maximum lag possible without breaking the unity of the
verse was determined for the earlier and later parts of the verse.
The verse unity was tested by adding enough feet to make a
full verse, after the break, and asking the subject to mark the
close of the verse. In every case this irregularity was introduced
into the second verse, and the first verse was normal,
<i>e.g.</i> (pentameter),</p>

<tr><td>I.</td><td>5 (34).</td></tr>
<tr><td>II.</td><td>34 lag 34  34 34  34 34.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>If the lag does not break the verse, the subject should hear
the close of the verse at the end of the fifth foot in II. If the
verse is broken he should ignore the first foot and make a new
verse, ending with the sixth foot.</p>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>3d</td><td>6</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Later, in the attempt to determine natural divisions, or nodes in
the verse, the following were determined:</p>

<div class="center"><table border="0" cellspacing="4" summary="">
<colgroup span="5"><col align="left" /><col span="4" align="right" /></colgroup>

<tr><td>Mi.</td><td>15</td><td>18</td><td>17</td><td>14</td></tr>
<tr><td>Me.</td><td>7.5</td><td>13</td><td>9.5</td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>R.</td><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>11</td><td>7</td></tr>
<tr><td>B.</td><td>12</td><td>8</td><td>15</td><td>7</td></tr>
<tr><td>H.</td><td>7.5</td><td>8</td><td>10</td><td>7</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="pagenum">[421]</span><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421"></a>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>B. Max pos. lags in dac. let., cat., in order</td><td>12</td><td>16</td><td>8</td></tr>
<tr><td>S.</td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>7</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mc.</td><td>7</td><td>10</td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>G.</td><td>11</td><td>11</td><td>7</td></tr>
<tr><td>L.</td><td>19</td><td>16</td><td>7</td></tr>
<tr><td>H.</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>4</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This shows that an irregularity in the time intervals may be
greater in the earlier than in the later part of the verse. This
last table is further evidence of the increased exactness of the
rhythmic perception at the close of the verse. As far as nodes
are concerned, they show clearly two types: (1) A node after
the second foot (L., G., Mi., Mc.) and (2) a node after the third
foot (R., B., H.). For the tetrameter there is some indication
in the cases of B., S. and Mc., but the other cases are negative
and further evidence is needed.</p>

<p>With three of the subjects, Mi., J. and K., it was not always
possible to get records of the maximum lag, since it was impossible
to define the verse unity. When this was unbroken it was
the unanimous testimony of the subjects, corroborated by their
unconscious movements, that there was a feeling of tension
during the lag. But the subjects just referred to got a type of
unity, and there was no tension. The lags were indefinite and
very long (35-90). This unity must be of the same kind as
the unity of the stanza, which includes long expressional pauses,
as well as rhythmic verse pauses.</p>

<p>If a subject is asked to fall in at the beginning of a rhythmic
series his first attempts are decidedly inco&ouml;rdinated. His
earliest reactions follow the clicks which they are intended to
represent, but presently the series of motor impulses generated
by the sounds and the voluntary movements which the subject
makes fuse into a voluntary type of reaction in which the cycle
has become automatic and definite, and the clicks take their
proper places as co&ouml;perating and controlling factors along with
the motor cues of the process itself. The accuracy of the judgments
of time, if such judgments be made, or the estimation of
the likeness of the groups, depends on the definiteness with
which movement sensations follow each other in a regular series.</p>

<p>The following experiments (Table I.) concern the perception
of a lag in different parts not of a verse but of a stanza. It was
<span class="pagenum">[422]</span><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422"></a>a question, namely, whether a lag in the first rhythmic series
(first verse) which establishes the motor cycle in the subject would
be detected in the later rhythmic series (later verses of the
stanza) after the motor cycle in the subject has been inaugurated.
This responsive motor cycle should itself, of course,
contain the lag given with the first rhythmic series.</p>

<p>A stanza of the form of A (Table I.) was clicked out by the
instrument, but the subject had no clue as to the regularity
or irregularity of any verse. The stanza was repeated as often
as the subject wished, but not without a pause of a few moments
between each repetition.</p>

<p class="tblexp">Any pause large enough to be noted in I. was noted in II. and III. (This
table contains the judgments made on all trials.)</p>

<p>Most of the judgments of the third set are due to the fact
that the subject first attended to the series on the second or third
verse. The large number of cases (83 per cent.) in which the
lags in the second and third verses were concealed by the equal
lag in the first verse, makes it very probable that the type of a
verse is somehow altered by the impression left by the preceding
verse.<span class="pagenum">[423]</span><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423"></a></p>

<p>The method of determining the maximal lags (as previously
described) gave interesting evidence on the point at which the
unity of the verse is actually felt. In the form</p>

<div class="center"><table summary="" cellpadding="3">
<colgroup span="2"><col align="right" /><col align="left" /></colgroup>
<tr><td>I.</td><td>5 (34)</td></tr>
<tr><td>II.</td><td>34 lag 34  34  34  34-34</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>as the lag increases, a point is reached at which the unity may
be made to include the first foot or to ignore it. Which of
these is done depends on the subject's attitude, or <i>on the point
at which the verse is brought to a close.</i> In either case the
unity, the 'pentameter feeling,' is not experienced <i>until the end
of the series unified is reached.</i> This is the case with all the
subjects.</p>

<p>This development of the feeling of the particular verse form
only at the end of the verse, and the fact that the subject may
be uncertain which form he will hear until the series has actually
ceased, shows that the verse-form movement is not of such
a character that the close of it may not be considerably modified.
A form which may fit the pentameter can be broken
off early, and become a satisfactory tetrameter. The feeling
seems to depend on some total effect of the verse at the close.
This effect is probably a blending of the mass-effect of the
impressions received thus far, which have a definite character
and feeling significance, and which form the motor disposition
for the next verse. The essential thing in the determination of
verse unity seems to be the dying out of the automatism, the
cessation of the co&ouml;rdination of the cyclic movement. The
rhyme, it would seem, emphasizes the close of the automatic
cycle. But it is probable that satisfactory phrasing has other
characteristics, and a definite form as a movement whole.</p>


<h4><i>2. The Relation of the Rhyme to the Verse Pause.</i></h4>

<p>Determinations of the minimal satisfactory verse pause were
made with a view to comparing the minimum in unrhymed with
that in rhymed verses.</p>

<p>The stanza used was of the following form:</p>

<table summary="" width="40%">
<colgroup span="5" align="right"></colgroup>
<tr><td>I.</td><td>34</td><td>34</td><td>34</td><td>p.</td></tr>
<tr><td>II.</td><td>&quot;</td><td>&quot;</td><td>&quot;</td><td>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>III.</td><td>&quot;</td><td>&quot;</td><td>&quot;</td><td>&quot;</td></tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum">[424]</span><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424"></a>The minimal satisfactory verse pauses were:</p>

<div class="center"><table width="60%" border="0" summary="SUBJECT, Without Rhyme, With Rhyme">
<colgroup span="4" align="center"></colgroup>
<tr><th colspan="2">&nbsp;</th><th>Without Rhyme.</th><th>With Rhyme.</th></tr>
<tr><td>Subject.</td><td>L.</td><td>6</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;</td><td>J.</td><td>5</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;</td><td>Mc.</td><td>6</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;</td><td>R.</td><td>7</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;</td><td>B.</td><td>6-7</td><td>3.5</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;</td><td>G.</td><td>6</td><td>3.5</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;</td><td>Mi.</td><td>6-7</td><td>3.25</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>It thus appears that the minimal pause which is satisfactory,
is less when rhyme is present than when it is not present.
Similar determinations were made for the maximal satisfactory
verse pauses, as follows:</p>


<div class="center"><table width="60%" border="0" cellpadding="4"  summary="SUBJECT, Without Rhyme, With Rhyme">
<colgroup span="4" align="center"></colgroup>
<tr><th colspan="2">&nbsp;</th><th>Without Rhyme.</th><th>With Rhyme.</th></tr>
<tr><td>Subject.</td><td>L.</td><td>9-10</td><td>11</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;</td><td>J.</td><td>8</td><td>9</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;</td><td>Mc.</td><td>9</td><td>9</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;</td><td>R.</td><td>10-11</td><td>10-11</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;</td><td>B.</td><td>9</td><td>9</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;</td><td>G.</td><td>11-12</td><td>11</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;</td><td>Mi.</td><td>10</td><td>10</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>(A few experiments were tried with verse pauses of different
length in the same stanza. A difference of one fourth the value
of the pause is not detected, and unless attention is called to
them, the pauses may vary widely from one another.)</p>

<p>This shows that the rhyme reduces the <i>necessary</i> pause in
verse to the mere foot pause; while at the same time as great a
pause is <i>possible</i> with rhyme as without it. Aside from the
table above, a large number of the records made for other
purposes support this statement: whenever rhyme was introduced,
the verse pause was made equal to the foot pause, or
even slightly less than it, and was always found satisfactory.</p>

<p>Numerous cases of introduction of lags into the verses of
rhymed stanzas go to show that irregularities in such verses do
not affect the length of the pauses.</p>

<p>Two hypotheses suggest themselves in explanation of the
striking fact that the verse pause becomes unnecessary at the
close of a rhymed verse.</p>

<p>The unity is now a new kind of verse unity; the rhyme is a
regular recurrent factor like the accent of a foot, and the series
<span class="pagenum">[425]</span><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425"></a>of rhymes generates a new rhythm. In the rhymed stanza we
are to see not a set of verses, like the verse of blank verse, but
a new and enlarged verse unity.</p>

<p>There are several decided objections to this conception.
First, the verse pause <i>may</i> be eliminated, but its elimination is
<i>not essential</i> to the rhyme effect; the verse pause may still be
as long, if not longer, with rhyme. Secondly, the larger unity
into which the verses enter is not in many cases a unity made
up exclusively of rhymed verses. Verses without rhyme alternate
with rhymed verses, and have the usual verse pause.
Thirdly, the rhyme is not merely a regularly recurring element:
it is essentially a recurring element of which one may say
what has been said falsely of the rhythm elements, that each
rhyme is either a repetition of something gone before to which
it refers, or the anticipation of something to which it looks
forward. In most cases, rhymes function in pairs. Such peculiarities
distinguish the rhyme from the accent of the foot.
Lastly, the freedom of the whole stanza structure into which
rhyme is introduced is much greater than that of the single
verse; pauses much larger than the admissible lags of a single
verse are possible between the verses, and there is no tension
which persists throughout. There is no feeling of strain if the
series halts at the verse ends.</p>

<p>A second hypothesis is that there is some definite process at
the end of the verse which marks the close of the verse and
which takes more time in the case of blank verse than in the case
of rhymed verse. If we conceive the end of the verse as a point
where a dying out of the tension occurs, we may imagine that
the rhyme brings an emphasis, and becomes a qualitative signal
for this release. The slight increase of intensity on the rhyme
contributes to the breaking up of the co&ouml;rdination, and at the
same time exhausts and satisfies the feeling of tension which
the verse embodies. It is at the point for finishing and releasing
the set of strains which constitute the motor image of the
verse. A qualitative change may be supposed to produce the
effect more rapidly than the simple dying out of the tensions,
which occurs in blank verse without a differentiated end
accent.<span class="pagenum">[426]</span><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426"></a></p>


<h4><i>3. The Relation of the Rhyme to the Cyclic Movement of
the Unit Group and of the Verse</i>.</h4>

<p>A series was arranged in which the accent of an ordinary
foot and a rhyme occurred side by side; the distance between
them was gradually lessened, and the effect on the rhyme and
on the ordinary accented element was noted.</p>

<p>A preliminary set of experiments on the effect of two accents
which approach each other gave some very interesting results.
Thus Table II. shows the effect of gradually eliminating the
verse pause from the couplet.</p>

<p>As soon as the accents are within a certain distance they
affect each other. As a rule the first retains its original intensity
and the second is weakened; rarely the first yields to the
second. The table shows that the distance at which this occurs
is about .42 seconds. Under many conditions it is quite possible
for two accents to occur at that distance, <i>e.g.</i>, in rapid rhythms,
without any 'fusing.' The subject has a type of rhythm very
definitely in mind and the only hypothesis which will explain
the difficulty in observing the type, in spite of the slight change
in time values, is that somehow the cyclic automatic movement
has been affected and can no longer produce the normal, limiting
sensation at the accent. There is not time for the phase of
relaxation before the next, objective, limiting sensation occurs.
We may figure the movement as follows:</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="./images/443-fig2.png" width="143" height="107" alt="FIG. 2." title="" /></div>
<p><i>A</i> is a curve in which <i>B</i> is the relaxation phase. At <i>C</i> the
tensions are rapidly increasing in anticipation of the next limiting
sensation at <i>A</i>. But if the objective factor
appears too early, the tensions will be discharged
prematurely, and the second accent
will be weakened. Exactly the obverse of these
phenomena is often noticed, when a slight retardation
of the second accent produces a slight increase in its intensity.
When, finally, the second accent has been moved so near the first
accent that it occurs within the phase of the first, it disappears
as an independent accent. At the same time the objective
stimuli immediately following now appear at quite irregular
intervals in the cycle, the co&ouml;rdination is broken up, and chaos
without accentuation for some distance is the result. Occasionally
the process does not right itself before the close of the verse.<span class="pagenum">[428]</span><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428"></a>
As this process eliminates the verse pause, the two verses become
one, as the accents approach each other. In cases where
the first accent is lost, one may suppose that the first accent
functions as an anticipatory stimulus, while the second simply
increases the effect (cf. Hofbauer and Cleghorn), and marks the
culmination. The fact that the second accent is only lost at
very close range favors this idea.</p>

<p>When the qualitatively different click representing the rhyme
is introduced, its most striking effect is decidedly to shorten the
possible distance between the two accents. This is in accord
with the notion suggested of the function of rhyme at the verse
end. The rhyme seems greatly to hasten the relaxation phase,
as compared with the time required in the ordinary foot.</p>

<p>There is a variety of forms possible to the unrhymed verse,
but that with the climax at the close is decidedly the most frequent.
When the rhyme is introduced the climax goes with it,
and the verse flows down as it were to the end. When the
<span class="pagenum">[429]</span><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429"></a>rhyme is put in the very first of the verse, however, a secondary
or even a primary accent may be developed at the close of the
verse. The natural place for the climax of the verse movement
is apparently at the close, and the fact that not only is the
earlier part of the verse more vague, but also that the end is
the natural, climactic position, makes the synthesizing and delimiting
factor, rhyme, preferable at the close.</p>

<p>The records of the next table were obtained by asking the
subjects to repeat the series with prescribed accents, until they

<p>The table shows that there is a decided tendency to prefer
rhymes in which the members of the rhyme have the same
interval. The only exception is in the case of couplets, where
two contrasting slides 5/ and . rhyme, whenever the finality
interval occurs last. Perhaps the similarity of pitch of the
rhyming syllables is a part of the 'Gestaltqualit&auml;t' whose
recognition brings about the release and satisfaction of the state
which we know as the 'feeling of expecting a rhyme.'
Definite pitch relations in music seem to make rhyme of little
significance. We seldom notice the rhymes in a hymn or in a
song of any musical worth. In comic operas and popular ditties
rhyme does now and then figure. In such cases the pitch
of the two or more rhyming syllables is identical; often the
whole phrase is repeated for each rhyming verse. A few
experiments in singing a rhyme to simple intervals show that
when the identical interval is used the two syllables rhyme well,
but if the interval be in the opposite direction, or in another
chord, the rhyme is very uncertain. It seems that in music we
usually have 'feelings of expectation' (<i>i.e.</i>, tensions of some
sort, central or peripheral), which are adequate to unite the
phrases into larger unities. These tensions are so definite and
<span class="pagenum">[432]</span><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432"></a>vivid that they quite obscure and swallow up the related condition
of rhyme expectation. These experiments on the modification
of the rhyme by the various pitch and accent factors are
not at all exhaustive or conclusive. An extended series of
experiments is needed. The study of sound records for pitch
is peculiarly tedious, but it should reveal some interesting relations
between rhyme and speech melody.</p>


<h3>III. THE SPEAKING OF A RHYTHMIC SERIES.</h3>


<h4>I. <i>Methods of Making Speech Records.</i></h4>

<p>The study of spoken rhythm is of primary importance.
Observations on what the subject really does are always open to
the objections that subjective factors play a large part, and that
the observer's perception of a rhythm is after all <i>his</i> perception of
the rhythm, not the subject's. The voice is an important indicator
of the activities which generate the rhythms of verse and
music, and some objective method of measuring the sounds
made is essential to a study of the rhythm production.</p>

<p>Methods of recording and studying the tones of the voice
are as numerous as they are unsatisfactory. In the main the
work has been done for purposes of phonetics, and but few of
the methods are applied in the psychological laboratory.</p>

<p>Marage<a name="FNanchor_13_114" id="FNanchor_13_114"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_13_114'>13</a> has an excellent summary of the methods with
practical comments on their applicability. Rousselot<a name="FNanchor_14_115" id="FNanchor_14_115"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_14_115'>14</a> (Histoire
des applications de phon&eacute;tique exp&eacute;rimentale, 401-417: objets
et appareils, 1-10 et 669-700) gives a careful history of the
methods from the phonetic point of view. Scripture<a name="FNanchor_15_116" id="FNanchor_15_116"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_15_116'>15</a> gives a
convenient English summary of the processes.</p>

<p>A few methods have been devised which avoid the difficulties
incident to the use of a diaphragm, but they are not applicable
to the measurement of rhythm material. The instruments
which might be used for recording spoken rhythms are all
modifications of two well-known forms of apparatus, the phonautograph
and the phonograph. The phonograph record is
incised in wax, and presents special difficulties for study.<span class="pagenum">[433]</span><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433"></a>
Boeke, however, has studied the wax record under a microscope,
with special arrangements for illumination. The work
is quite too tedious to permit of its use for material of any
length, though it is fairly satisfactory when applied to single
vowels. In order to enlarge the record, and at the same time
to obtain the curves in the plane of the record surface, Hermann
devised an attachment to the phonograph (cf. Marage, loc.
citat.) by which the movements of the stylus of the phonograph
are magnified by a beam of light and recorded on photographic
paper. The measurements of entire words by this method
would be as tedious as by Boeke's.</p>

<p>E.W. Scripture has chosen another type of talking machine
from which to obtain transcribed records. The permanent
record of the gramophone (which makes a record in the plane
of the surface, like the phonautograph) is carefully centered,
and a lever attached to a stylus which follows the furrow of
the record transcribes the curve on the kymographic drum as
the plate is slowly revolved. The method has the advantage
of using a record which may be reproduced (<i>i.e.</i> the original
gramophone record may be reproduced), and of giving fairly
large and well defined curves for study. It is too laborious to
be applied to extended research on speech rhythms, and has
besides several objections. The investigator is dependent on
the manufacturer for his material, which is necessarily limited,
and cannot meet the needs of various stages of an investigation.
He knows nothing of the conditions under which the record
was produced, as to rate, on which time relations depend, as to
tone of voice, or as to muscular accompaniments. There are
also opportunities for error in the long lever used in the transcription;
small errors are necessarily magnified in the final
curve, and the reading for intensity (amplitude of the curve) is
especially open to such error.</p>

<p>The stylus of such a recording apparatus as is used by the
gramophone manufacturers, is subject to certain variations,
which may modify the linear measurements (which determine
time relations). The recording point is necessarily flexible;
when such a flexible point is pressed against the recording surface
it is dragged back slightly from its original position by
<span class="pagenum">[434]</span><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434"></a>friction with this surface. When the point is writing a curve
the conditions are changed, and it sways forward to nearly its
original position. This elongates the initial part of the sound
curve. This fact is of little importance in the study of a single
vowel, for the earlier part of the curve may be disregarded,
but if the entire record is to be measured it is a source of error.
Hensen<a name="FNanchor_16_117" id="FNanchor_16_117"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_16_117'>16</a> first turned the phonautograph to account for the
study of speech. He used a diaphragm of goldbeater's skin, of
conical shape, with a stylus acting over a fulcrum and writing on
a thinly smoked glass plate. The apparatus was later improved
by Pipping, who used a diamond in place of the steel point. The
diamond scratched the record directly on the glass. The Hensen-Pipping
apparatus has the advantage of taking records directly
in the plane of the surface, but it does not make a record
which can be reproduced; in case of doubt as to the exact thing
represented by the curve, there is no means of referring to the
original sounds; and it involves working with a microscope.</p>


<div class="center">

<p class="nosccaption"><span class="sc">Fig. 3</span>. Diagrammatic section of recording apparatus. <i>a</i>, diaphragm;
<i>s</i>, stylus; <i>g</i>, guide; <i>p</i>, section of plate.</p></div>

<p>The apparatus which was used in the following experiments
consisted essentially of two recording devices&mdash;an ordinary
phonograph, and a recorder of
the Hensen type writing on a
rotary glass disc (see Fig. 5,
Plate X.). Of the phonograph
nothing need be said. The Hensen
recorder, seen in cross section
in Fig. 3, was of the simplest
type. A diaphragm box of the
sort formerly used in the phonograph
was modified for the
purpose. The diaphragm was
of glass, thin rubber, or goldbeater's
skin. The stylus was
attached perpendicularly to the
surface of the diaphragm at its
center. The stylus consisted
of a piece of light brass wire bent into a right angle; the longer
arm was perpendicular to the diaphragm; the shorter arm was
<span class="pagenum">[435]</span><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435"></a>tipped with a very fine steel point, which pointed downward
and wrote on the disc; the point was inclined a trifle to the disc,
in order that it might 'trail,' and write smoothly on the moving
disc. The stylus had no fulcrum or joint, but recorded directly
the vibrations of the diaphragm. In early experiments,
the diaphragm and stylus were used without any other attachment.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="./images/451-fig4.png" width="147" height="108"  alt="FIG. 4." title="" /></div>
<p>But a flexible point writing on smoked glass is a source of
error. When the disc revolves under the stylus, the flexibility
of the diaphragm and of the stylus permit it to be dragged forward
slightly by the friction of the moving surface. When the
diaphragm is set vibrating the conditions are altered, and the
stylus springs back to nearly its original position. The apparent
effect is an elongation of the earlier part of the curve
written, and a corresponding compression of the last verse written.
This error is easily tested by starting the disc, and without
vibrating the diaphragm stopping the disc; the
stylus is now in its forward position; speak
into the apparatus and vibrate the diaphragm,
and the stylus will run backward to its original
position, giving an effect in the line like <i>a</i> (Fig.
4). If the error is eliminated, the stylus will remain in position
throughout, and the trial record will give a sharp line across the
track of the stylus as in <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>This source of error was avoided by fixing a polished steel rod
or 'guide' at right angles to the vertical part of the stylus,
just in front of the stylus; the stylus trailed against this rod,
and could not spring out of position. The friction of the rod
did not modify the record, and the rod gave much greater
certainty to the details of the sound curve, by fixing the position
of the vibrating point. This rod or guide is shown in Fig. 3 (<i>g</i>).</p>

<p>The disc was driven directly from the phonograph by a
very simple method. A fine chain was fixed to the shaft carrying
the disc, and wrapped around a pulley on the shaft. The
chain was unwound by the forward movement of the recording
apparatus of the phonograph against the constant tension of a
spring. When the phonograph apparatus was brought back to
the beginning of a record which had been made, the spring
<span class="pagenum">[436]</span><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436"></a>wound up the chain, and the disc revolved back to its original
position.</p>

<p>A <b>T</b> from the speaking-tube near the diaphragm box was
connected by a rubber tube with the phonograph recorder, so
that the voice of the speaker was recorded both on the smoked
glass plate and on the phonograph cylinder. The advantages
of such a double record are that the possible error of a transcription
process is eliminated, and yet there is an original
record to which it is possible to refer, and by which the record
measured may be checked.</p>

<p>An important feature in the method was the rate at which
the disc revolved. The disc turned so slowly that the vibrations,
instead of being spread out as a harmonic curve, were
closely crowded together. This had two great advantages;
the measurements were not so laborious, and the intensity
changes were much more definitely seen than in the elongated
form of record. Each syllable had an intensity form, as a
'box,' 'spindle,' 'double spindle,' 'truncated cone,' 'cone,'
etc. (cf. <a href="#Page_446">p. 446</a>).</p>

<p>The disc was run, as a rule, at a rate of about one revolution
in two minutes. The rate could be varied to suit the purposes
of the experimenter, and it was perfectly possible to procure
the usual form of record when desired. As a result of the
low rate, the records were exceedingly condensed. The
records of the 300 stanzas measured are on two glass discs of
about 25 cm. diameter, and as much more could still be
recorded on them.</p>

<p>The diaphragm and the speaking tube were the great
sources of error. For measurements of time values the particular
component of the tone to which the diaphragm happens
to vibrate is not important, but the record of intensities depends
on the fidelity with which the diaphragm responds to a given
component, preferably the fundamental, of the tone. The
speaking tube has a resonance of its own which can be but
partly eliminated. For the records here recorded either glass
or goldbeater's skin was used as a diaphragm. Goldbeater's
skin has the advantage of being very sensitive, and it must be
used if the subject has not a resonant voice. It has the great
disadvantage of being extremely variable. It is very sensitive
to moisture, even when kept as loose as possible, and cannot be
depended on to give the same results from day to day. The
records marked Hu., Ha. and G. were usually taken with a
glass diaphragm, which has the advantage of being invariable.
As the phonograph records show, glass does not modify the
lower tones of the male voice to any extent.</p>

<div class="center"><a name="PLATE10"></a><span class="sc">Psychological Review. Monograph Supplement, 17. Plate X.</span>

<p class="sccaption">Opposite p. 436.</p></div>

<p>The apparatus is shown arranged for taking parallel records on the smoked
glass disc, and on the cylinder of the graphophone. On the left is shown the
microscope with which the records on the glass disc were measured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[437]</span><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437"></a>The speaking-tube used was of woven material, not of rubber,
and a pad of felt was kept in the tube near the diaphragm
box. As far as possible more damping was used at the other end
of the tube, but this had to depend on the voices of the subjects.</p>

<p>The best check on the performances of a diaphragm is the
number per second and character of the vibrations. The pitch
may be calculated from the rotation rate of the disc, which is
very constant, as it is driven at a low rate by the well-regulated
high-speed motor of the phonograph. But it is better to place
a fork in position to write on the disc and take a parallel record.
All the records were taken with the vowel 'a' (sound as in
father). This vowel has a very characteristic signature, which
is easily seen, even in a very closely packed curve, and the correctness
of this is one of the best guarantees that the fundamental
of the tone is actuating the diaphragm (though that does
not mean that the diaphragm is actually giving the vibration
frequency of that fundamental).</p>

<p>Every record was repeated at least twice, and both records
were measured. In many of the experiments the intensities
were fixed by the conditions of the experiment. There was
always the corroborative testimony of the phonograph diaphragm;
for the two were not apt to err together. It was easy
to determine if the actual intensity relations were preserved in
the phonograph (but it could not be taken for granted). Each
record was reproduced on the phonograph immediately after it
had been taken, and both subject and operator listened for
anomalies. In practice it was not hard to get records of the
single vowel used (at a small range of pitch which was never
more than a third or fourth and was nearly always much less)
which represented fairly well the relative intensities. Beside
the checks spoken of above, every record was repeated by a
<span class="pagenum">[438]</span><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438"></a>number of subjects, and the comparison of the results of different
voices shows uniformity.</p>

<p>The recording of spoken verse is another matter. It is not
difficult to test a diaphragm carefully through a small range, but
to be certain of its action at all the pitches and qualities of the
speaking voice is impossible. A stable diaphragm, glass or
mica, would have to be used, and careful corrections made for
the different vowels.</p>

<p>At best, when the records are satisfactory, nothing can be
said for the measurements of intensity but that they represent
relations of more or less; the diaphragm has a minimum intensity,
below which it does not vibrate, and a maximum intensity,
above which the amplitude of its vibrations does not materially
increase without breaking into partials and 'blasting.'</p>

<p>The disc recorder, which had for a mount a modified microscope
stand, was placed on the shoe of the disc stand and
clamped. The wax and disc records were adjusted at known
starting-points and the stylus carefully lowered, by the rack and
pinion adjustment, to the surface of the disc. After a preliminary
trial of the diaphragm the apparatus was started, and
when at full speed at least two satisfactory records of the
material were taken. When the disc had made a single revolution&mdash;a
record of some ten or fifteen stanzas&mdash;the recorder
was fed inward to a new circle on the disc. After the records
were taken, a microscope with either 2 or 4 Leitz objective and
a micrometer ocular was substituted for the recorder. The
phonograph recorder was raised and drawn back to its starting
point, and the disc came back to its original position. The
microscope was focussed, and adjusted by the screw of the shoe
until it had the record line in its field; the micrometer furnished
an object of reference in the field. The phonograph, now
carrying the reproducer&mdash;if possible without a horn, as the
tones are truer&mdash;was started. At the first syllable of the record
the apparatus was stopped by the device furnished on the 'Commercial'
phonograph, and the plate was turned by adjusting
the screw at the phonograph carriage, which changed the length
of the chain connecting the two records, until the record of the
first syllable was at some chosen point in the field. In cases of
<span class="pagenum">[439]</span><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439"></a>records of poetry it was found better to have a set of syllables,
say 'one, two, three' prefixed to the record, for this adjustment.
The phonograph was again started, and the curve-forms representing
the spoken syllables filed past the point as the phonograph
repeated each syllable. The rate was slow enough, with
the objective 2, so that there was no difficulty in observing the
passing syllables. After the conformity of the phonograph
record had been noted by the operator, and the subject had
passed judgment on the phonograph as saying satisfactorily
what he had said, the curve-forms were measured with the
micrometer. The record was fed slowly through the field by
means of the chain screw on the phonograph carriage; and
measurements of the lengths of syllables gave their time values.
The micrometer was passed back and forth across the form by
the shoe screw, for the measurements of amplitude (intensity).
The micrometer measurements in this case could be made at
least as rapidly as measurements of kymograph curves. The
measurements, with the powers used, are accurate to.01 sec.</p>

<p>The smoked disc records are to be preferred to those
scratched with a diamond, because of the superior legibility of
the line, an important item if thousands of measurements are to
be made. The records are fixed with shellac and preserved, or
they may be printed out by a photographic process and the prints
preserved. The parallel set of wax records is preserved with
them. There are several ways in which the wax records lend
themselves to the study of rhythmic questions. It is easy to
change the rate, and thereby get new material for judgment, in a
puzzling case. Consonant qualities are never strong, and it is
easy so to damp the reproducer that only the vowel intensities
are heard. The application in the study of rhyme is obvious.</p>

<p>All the series consisted of regular nonsense syllables. The
accented and unaccented elements were represented by the
single syllable 'ta' ('a' as in father). Rhymes were of the
form 'da,' 'na,' 'ga' and 'ka.' In other parts of the work (cf.
Table IV.) the vowel o had been used in rhymes for contrast;
but the same vowel, a, was used in these records, to make the
intensity measurements comparable.</p>

<p>The records of the measurements were as complete as possible.<span class="pagenum">[440]</span><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440"></a>
The sonant and the interval of each element were
measured, and all the pauses except the stanza pause were recorded.
The intensity of each syllable was recorded beneath
the length of the syllable, and notes were made both from the
appearance of the curve and from the phonograph record.</p>


<h4><i>2. The Normal Form of Unrhymed Verse.</i></h4>

<p>To determine the influence of a subordinate factor in rhythm
such as rhyme, it is necessary to know the normal form of
verse without this factor. It is natural to assume that the simplest
possible form of material would be individual feet recorded
seriatim. But on trial, such material turned out to be
very complex; the forms changed gradually, iambs becoming
trochees and trochees changing into spondees. It is very probable
that the normal foot occurs only in a larger whole, the verse.</p>

<p>To corroborate the conclusions from perceived rhythms as
to the existence of variations in earlier and later parts of the
verse, a table of mean variations was prepared from the material
recorded and measured for other purposes.</p>

<p>The mean variations of the table (Table VI.) were calculated
as follows: The average for all the elements of the stanza was
obtained and an average foot constructed (excluding the last
sonant and the pause of the verse). From this average foot
the variations of all the first feet were computed, then the variations
of all the second feet, etc. Then the variations of the
first feet of the stanza were averaged and percentages taken,
etc.; it is this last value which goes to the making up of the
<span class="pagenum">[442]</span><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442"></a>tables. In inspecting the averages the corresponding elements
of the feet should be compared. Any increased length due to
a prescribed accent within the verse, etc., appears in the
averages as a corresponding increase in the mean variation at
that point, and only the first and last feet can be compared as
to the variations in the verse as a whole. In making up the
tables the material was grouped, not by combining the records
of each subject, but by combining all the stanzas of a single
type, in order to eliminate individual peculiarities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[443]</span><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443"></a>Throughout the series of measurements made the accented
element was nearly always longer, and in no case did the
accent fail to increase the length of the sonant. Ebhardt's
suggestion that there are two significant parts in each foot-element,
viz., sonant and pause, does not seem good. Although
the sonant is much longer when accented, the ratio
between the sonant and the following interval is not definite.</p>

<p>An examination of thirty-two stanzas of unrhymed iambic
and dactylic (catalectic) tetrameters (cf. Table VII.) shows that
the verse pause is always at least one fourth larger than the
foot pause. In the unrhymed stanzas the verse pause varies
widely, and may be as large as three times the foot pause. A
pause longer than the foot pause is absolutely essential to the
unity of the verse. All sorts of ratios are presented; evidently
the verse pause is not a function of the foot pause.</p>

<p>The next table (Table VIII.) shows a variety of different
dynamic shadings in the verse. It is noteworthy that in these
nonsense verses the type is uniform throughout the stanza.
Representing the intensities by curves similar to those used by
the subjects in listening to rhythms, we have the forms shown
in Fig. 6 (<i>a</i>).</p>

<p>The general curve is like that in Fig. 6(<i>b</i>).</p>

<p class="sccaption">Fig. 6.</p></div>

<p>When a special emphasis is prescribed on some particular
accent in the verse, the type becomes invariable, not only in
each stanza, but for all stanzas of all subjects.</p>

<p>The records show that the accent is produced in a variety of
ways. One, for example, gets the accent by a slight increase
in intensity, but especially by a pause following the sonant.<span class="pagenum">[444]</span><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444"></a></p>

<p>Frequently the special accent seems to be made by a contrast
between the accented foot and the feet which follow. In most
cases the influence of the special accent is to be seen, not
merely within the accented foot itself, but both before and after
the accented foot. Often the appearance under the microscope
is very striking; the sonants of the feet, both accented and
unaccented, increase to the special accent and then decrease in
a regular crescendo&mdash;diminuendo form. Much of this is not
shown by the mere measurements.<span class="pagenum">[446]</span><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446"></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[447]</span><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447"></a>In general the special accent may he said to be the climax
of the verse movement. It is the crest of the wave, and, as
noted above, the dynamic shading is not always made by an
increase up to the accent, nor by a stress on a special accent,
but by a sharp diminuendo immediately following the accent.
A study of the phonograph record brings out these forms of
shading, especially when the record is repeated slowly, exaggerating
the dynamic variations and giving an opportunity for
more careful observation.</p>

<p>Within the verse the general form of the syllable as it
appears in the mass of closely written vibrations, often varies,
but nearly always shows a square end. Several very common
shapes are noticed and appear in the record as (1) 'truncated
cones,' (2) 'boxes,' and (3) 'truncated spindles.' (See Fig. 7.)</p>

<p>With the particular syllable used, 'ta,' the beginning of
curve form was usually square and abrupt (4), and not gradual
(5), although a few of the latter type are found ('spindle').</p>

<p>One syllable form has an especial interest, because of its
bearing on the problem of 'finality' feeling at the close of the
verse. At the close of each verse, whether with or without
rhyme, the syllable form is always a 'cone' (6) (cf. Fig. 8).
Of about 600 verses measured not more than 15 are exceptions
to this rule. Of these 15 exceptions 10 are under special conditions
and confirm the hypothesis that this form is related to the
finality process. The form very rarely occurs within the verse,
and when it does it is usually before some c&aelig;sura, or under
unusual conditions.</p>

<p>This 'cone' form of the closing syllable of the verse indicates
a falling of the intensity of the voice. It is often,
though not always, associated with a fall in the pitch, showing
relaxation of the vocal cords. It seems to be an indication of
the dying out of the intensity factor, a sinking of the tension,
at the close of the verse. In the case of unrhymed verses,
with long verse pause, the cone is often very much elongated,
and it is quite impossible to say where the sound ceases.</p>

<p>Special accentuation of the long syllable of the foot increases
the length of the sonant, of the accented element, and of the
entire foot. There is probably a slight increase of the total
<span class="pagenum">[448]</span><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448"></a>length of an accented verse as compared with the similar unaccented,
but no calculations were made to show that point.
This is quite in accord with other results (Meumann, Ebhardt).
This special accentuation is connected with an increased mean
variation of the time values, as noted above. It is in that sense
a 'disturbing factor.'</p>

<h4>3. <i>Modification of the Normal Form of Verse due to Rhyme.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Verse Pause in Rhymed Material.</span></p>

<p>There are as wide, isolated variations as in the case of unrhymed
material. As compared with unrhymed verse, the
pause is in general decidedly shorter. The verse pauses of the
feminine rhymes are generally much like those of the end
rhymed material. But there are very few cases of the verse
pause being as short as the foot pause&mdash;only four cases in sixty
(6.6 per cent.). See Table IX.</p>

<p>This wide variation of the verse pause and its occasional
equivalence to the foot pause in rhymed verses is in accord with
the notion that the rhyme in some way brings the verse to a
close by a process more rapid than that in unrhymed material.</p>

<p>The introduction of rhyme seems to be favorable to the division
of a stanza into two parts by producing an unusually long
verse pause after the second verse. Of 43 unrhymed stanzas
there are 19 which show a decidedly long pause at the close of
some one of the verses. But of these 19 cases, only 8 (18 per
cent.) have the break at the close of the second verse. Of 64
rhymed stanzas, 29 show the division, and of this 29, 22 (34
per cent.) have the break at the close of the second verse.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="sc">Influence of the Rhymes on Intensities.</span></p>

<p>The intensities at the close of the verse, without rhyme, may
be slightly greater than within the verse. The dynamic shading
of the verse is elastic, and a variety of forms is possible, a
decrescendo at the close of the verse is not unusual (cf. Table
VIII.). But when the rhyme is introduced the general dynamic
form of the verse is fixed, and in the material measured this is
true not only of the verses in a stanza which contain the rhyme
but of other verses in the same stanza.</p>

<p>Of the 32 verses containing rhymes in Table X., but four
verses are exceptions to the rule of an increase of intensity on
the rhyme. There are two cases of double, alternating rhymes
where it is doubtful if the subject actually felt one of the alternating
rhymes. This increase of intensity on the rhyme is not
confined to that particular syllable or foot; often, as indicated
<span class="pagenum">[450]</span><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450"></a>by the italics, the influence of the accent makes itself felt
earlier in the verse.</p>

<p>The evidence of an increased intensity on the rhyme is not
so positive in the case of rhymes in the third foot. Among the
rhymes in the second foot there is but one exception. The
rhymes in the second and third feet were never given very
satisfactorily by several of the subjects. The rhymes within
<span class="pagenum">[451]</span><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451"></a>the verse determine a climax in the foot in which they occur,
and all the verses follow this well-defined type. It is interesting
to note, in studying the phonographic record, that in verses
in which the accentuation of the rhythm is not very definite, the
accentuation is perceived when the record is repeated at the
normal speed. If the record is repeated more slowly, and
especially at such a distance that the rhyming consonants cannot
be distinguished, then the accentuation seems to disappear.
It is probable that after a verse or stanza type has been established
the voice may deviate from the type, and the accentuation
will be supplied by the hearer.</p>

<h3><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453"></a>IV. SUGGESTIONS FOR A MOTOR THEORY OF RHYTHM.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum">[453]</span>If the basis of rhythm is to be found in muscular sensations,
rather than in the supposed activity of some special 'mental'
function, the nature of the movement cycle involved is of the
greatest interest.</p>

<p>In every case where a rhythm comes to peripheral expression,
there are two opposing sets of muscles involved. If a
rhythmic movement be attempted with but a single set of muscles
at work, it is very unsatisfactory and soon ends in the tonic
contraction of the muscle set. One may assume that in all
cases of rhythm perception there is a cycle of movement sensations
involved, and that the simplest possible case of a peripheral
rhythmic movement is the type of any rhythm. In tapping
a rhythm with the finger, the flexors which bring the finger
down become the positive muscle set, and the opposing
extensor muscles which raise the finger for the next blow become
the negative muscle set.</p>

<p>In Fig. 9 the upper curve represents the actual movement of
the finger tip, and the heavy lines <i>a</i>, <i>a'</i>, <i>a''</i> represent the pressure-tension-sound
sensation which we call the 'beat,' and
which is the limiting sensation of the rhythm, and the regulating
factor in the movement cycle of the rhythm. The movement
is divided into two phases; <i>B</i>, the phase of relaxation,
during which the finger is raised, and <i>A</i>, the phase of contraction,
during which the finger delivers the blow which produces
the beat.</p>

<p>The curves below represent the changes in the two opposing
sets of muscles whose interaction brings about the movement
cycle. The contraction of the flexors, the positive muscle set,
is represented by the curve above the base line. It is obvious
that during the contraction phase, the contraction in the positive
muscle set is at its height; it continues at a maximum during
<span class="pagenum">[454]</span><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454"></a>the limiting sensation and then dies away during the relaxation
phase. The sensations from this positive muscle set have the
principal place in consciousness during the rhythm experience.
The curve below the base line represents the contraction of the
extensors, the negative muscle set. The contraction of the
negative muscles reaches its climax very soon after the maximum
contraction of the positive muscles, in the contraction
phase. The sharp tension between the two opposing sets of
muscles at the limiting sensation may be made very apparent if
the finger beats the rhythm entirely in the air; in that case the
limiting sensation consists entirely of the feeling of a sudden increase
of tension between the positive and negative muscle sets.
During the relaxation phase the contraction of the negative
muscles continues, but the tension between the two sets grows
less and less, for the positive muscles are rapidly relaxing. At
the highest point in the movement either muscle set is exerting
but very little strain; the condition is represented in the figure
by the approach of either curve to the base-line; the amount of
tension between the two sets is figured by the distance of the
two curves from each other.</p>

<p class="sccaption">Fig. 9.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[455]</span><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455"></a>Assuming such a movement cycle, in which the tension between
the two opposing sets never comes to zero until the close
of the series, it is not difficult to arrange many of the facts of
rhythmic perception under the motor theory.</p>

<p>1. The feeling of rhythm is more definite as we proceed in
a verse, or a series of simple sound sensations. At first the
cycle is not perfectly adjusted and complete automatism established.</p>

<p>2. If an observer is listening to a series, and an unusually
long pause is introduced between two beats, there is always a
feeling of suspense or tension during the 'lag.' As long as
the tensions are maintained there is a rhythmic continuity; the
feeling of tension is the strain of opposition between the opposing
muscle sets.</p>

<p>3. The continuity of the rhythmic series, whereby all the
beats of a period seem to belong to a single whole, is due to the
continuity of the muscle sensations involved and the continuous
feeling of slight tension between the positive and negative
muscle sets; nowhere within the period does the feeling of
strain die out.</p>

<p>4. But at the close of the period we have a pause which is
demonstrably not a function of any of the intervals of the
period. During this pause the tension between the two sets
'dies out,' and we have a feeling of finality. This gradual
dying out of the tension is clearly seen in the constant appearance
of the cone-shaped final syllable at the end of each nonsense
verse.</p>

<p>5. The period composed of a number of unit groups (the
verse, in nonsense syllables) has a general form which suggests
strongly that it has the unity of a single co&ouml;rdinated movement.<span class="pagenum">[456]</span><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456"></a>
There is no more reason for assuming a transcendental mental
activity in the case of a rhythmic period than in the case of a
single act which appears in consciousness as a unity. Undoubtedly
the breathing is correlated with the rhythmic movements and
may be a factor in determining the verse period. Meumann's
principal accent, about which a number of subordinate accents
are grouped, is characteristic not only of poetry but of the
simplest rhythms. At some point in the period there is a
definite climax, a chief accent; the movement 'rises' to that
point and then falls off. This is strikingly seen in nonsense
verses spoken with a heavy accent within the verse. The
accent does not stand out from a dead level, but the verse culminates
at that point.</p>

<p>Unfortunately very little is known of the mechanism of so
simple a co&ouml;rdinated muscular activity as that necessary for a
simple rhythm. Sherrington<a name="FNanchor_17_118" id="FNanchor_17_118"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_17_118'>17</a> and Hering<a name="FNanchor_18_119" id="FNanchor_18_119"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_18_119'>18</a>have pointed out the
primary character of the grouping of the muscles in opposing
sets and the reciprocal nature of almost all muscular activity,
but in a review of the work of co&ouml;rdinated movements Hering
denies any simultaneous stimulation of the two sets and considers
the question of the innervation mechanism of opposing
muscle-sets entirely unsettled.</p>

<p>That the connection between the positive and negative set of
muscles in a rhythmic movement is very close, and that the reaction
is of the circular type, is evident from the automatic character
of all rhythmic movements, and it is evident that the limiting
sensation is the primary cue in the reaction. Anything
further is mere hypothesis. Robert M&uuml;ller's<a name="FNanchor_19_120" id="FNanchor_19_120"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_19_120'>19</a> thorough criticism
of the Mosso ergograph throws great doubt on the present
methods of investigation and invalidates conclusions from the
various curves of voluntary movements which have been obtained.</p>

<p>The curve of contraction and relaxation of a simple muscle
is well known and is not affected by M&uuml;ller's criticism. Its
chief characteristic, with or without opposing tension, is the inequality
<span class="pagenum">[457]</span><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457"></a>of the intervals of the contraction and relaxation phases.
As one might expect, since a single set of muscles dominates in
a rhythmic movement, the typical rhythmic curve has the general
character of the curve of the simple muscle. The average
values of the phases of curves of simple rhythmic movement
obtained by A. Cleghorn<a name="FNanchor_20_121" id="FNanchor_20_121"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_20_121'>20</a> from a large number of observations
with at least three subjects, are as follows: phase of contraction,
.44 second; phase of relaxation, .54 second. It is very significant
for a motor theory of rhythm that this general form of the
curve of rhythmic movement may easily be altered in all sorts
of fashions by unusual stimuli to the two muscle sets.</p>

<p>While it is well recognized that a rhythm does not consist
necessarily of sound sensations, the 'rhythmization' of a series
of sound sensations in the ordinary perceived rhythms is a matter
of great interest. Ewald found strong reasons for believing
that the ear is peculiarly connected with the motor apparatus.
The experiments of Hofbauer<a name="FNanchor_21_122" id="FNanchor_21_122"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_21_122'>21</a> and Cleghorn<a name="FNanchor_22_123" id="FNanchor_22_123"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_22_123'>22</a>show that any
strong stimulus to either eye or ear modifies decidedly the reactions
of co&ouml;rdinated muscles. How shall we assume that the
automatic movement cycle necessary to rhythmic perception is
set up when one listens to a series of sounds?</p>

<p>It must be assumed that any chance sound sets up a contraction
in a set of muscles, however large or small. If but a single
sound occurs, the phase of contraction in that muscle set is followed
by a longer phase of relaxation, and the musculature is
passive as before; it may be that the stretching of the antagonistic
set of muscles weakly stimulates them, and they then contract
during the relaxation phase and assist in restoring the
original condition.</p>

<p>But if a second sound occurs toward the end of the relaxation
phase, before the tension is quite exhausted, the movement will
be repeated; the negative set of muscles will be more definitely
stimulated, for the activity will not have been exhausted when the
second sound occurs. If the sound continues to recur at regular
intervals, the movement cycle thus established will rapidly become
<span class="pagenum">[458]</span><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458"></a>co&ouml;rdinated. The positive set in its vigorous contraction furnishes
a limiting sensation which becomes a cue for its own relaxation
and for the reciprocal contraction of the negative muscle
set. The contraction of the negative muscle set and the resulting
changes in tension may become in turn a cue for the positive
set. The reaction is now of the circular type and the
process has become self-regulative, though constantly reinforced
by the recurring sound (which has become a part of the limiting
sensation of the rhythmic movement cycle).</p>

<p>But it is very probable that the second sound may not be
timed so as to come at the close of the relaxation phase in the
set of muscles roused; moreover, in almost all rhythms there are
secondary sounds occurring between the main beats. What
happens when a sound occurs out of place, early in the phase
of relaxation, or just before or just after the climax in the contraction
phase? Does it make it impossible to establish the
co&ouml;rdination, or destroy it if already established?</p>

<p>Hofbauer demonstrated that a stimulus which appears in
close proximity to the limiting sensation, <i>either before or after</i>,
always increases the force of the reaction, so that such a slight
displacement could not affect the rhythm, which would quickly
readjust itself. The possibility of a stimulus occurring in the
relaxation phase is of much more importance for a motor theory
of the initiation of a rhythmic movement. Cleghorn made the
stimulus occur at the beginning of the relaxation phase. Instead
of prolonging or reinstating the contraction phase, he found that
the stimulus <i>intensified the relaxation process and shortened its
period</i>. &quot;The stimulated relaxation is not only quicker than
the normal, but also more complete; the end of the normal relaxation
is slow; ... relaxation under the influence of the
stimulus, on the contrary, shows nothing of this, but is a sudden
sharp drop directly to the base line and sometimes below it.&quot;
A comparison of the normal phases with the same phases, when
the stimulus occurs within the relaxation phase, follows:</p>

<div class="indent"><p>Normal: Contraction-phase, .44 sec.; relaxation-phase, .54 sec.;
total, .98 sec.</p>
<p>With stim.: Contraction-phase, .47 sec.: relaxation-phase, .30 sec.;
total, .77 sec.</p></div>

<p>It will be noticed that the total time of the movement cycle
is reduced. One may then assume that a sound which occurs
<span class="pagenum">[459]</span><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459"></a>too early to become a factor in the limiting sensation, functions
as a stimulus to the relaxation process and shortens the interval
between the limiting sensations. Thus the movement cycle
would be modified, but not destroyed. It is impossible to say
just how the relaxation process is affected, and Cleghorn's own
conclusions are open to criticism in the light of M&uuml;ller's comments
on the method. The simplest assumption would be that
the stimulus acted on the negative set of muscles.</p>

<p>E.W. Scripture<a name="FNanchor_23_124" id="FNanchor_23_124"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_23_124'>23</a> objects to such a 'tonus theory,' because
some subjects regularly react <i>before</i> the signal. But in no
case in the published records to which he refers is the error more
than.05 sec. either before or after the signal. The investigation
of Hofbauer shows conclusively that in such cases the effect
of the external stimulus simply fuses with the limiting
sensation. Scripture overlooks the automatic character of the
rhythmic movement.</p>

<p>There is a striking difference between rhythmic movement
from unit group to unit group within a period, and movement
from period to period (<i>i.e.</i>, from verse to verse of nonsense
syllables). Each foot is simply the repetition of the movement
cycle; all the tensions are maintained, and each foot is an integral
part of a larger act. At the close of the period (verse)
the active tensions die out, either because of the introduction of
some unusual stimulus which causes the positive muscle set to
strike a heavy blow, and abruptly upset the balanced tensions, or
because a pause of indefinite length ensues in which the tensions
die out. This is the process which we call 'finality.'</p>

<p>In the stanza there is evidently a different type of unity from
that in the single verse. When we hear the first verse of the
stanza, we do not know what the verse whole is, until the finality
factor or the verse pause is reached, at its close. Then
the verse has a certain definite cumulative effect, a synthetic
effect which results from the echoes of the various movements
and the total effect on the organism. One may call it the tetrameter
feeling. The verse pause may vary within large
limits, but after a few verses there is a definite scheme, or
'Gestaltqualit&auml;t,' which represents the verse unity. It is some
<span class="pagenum">[460]</span><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460"></a>sort of a memory image, which functions as a cue to the motor
process. This motor image, set of strains, or whatever it be,
is more than a mere standard by which we judge the present
verse. The memory image fuses in some way with the living
motor process. <i>The preceding verse affects the character of
the following verse.</i> An irregularity, easily noted in the first
verse, is obscure in the second, and not detected in the third
verse, when the verses are identical.</p>

<p>The experiments of Hofbauer and Cleghorn, and many
facts about the unit groups themselves, make it evident that the
function of stimuli, during the movement cycle, varies with the
position of the stimulus in that cycle. This offers a possible
explanation of the striking peculiarities of the unit groups. The
iamb [\/ _'] and the trochee [_' \/] should be quite alike for a general
synthesizing process; but not only is the experiential character
of the two quite unlike, but the ratio between their intervals is
entirely different.</p>

<p>A number of measurements by different observers show
that in the iambic foot the unaccented syllable is proportionately
much shorter than the unaccented syllable in the trochaic foot.
It is very easy to beat a simple up-and-down accompaniment
to a series of simple feet of nonsense syllables; in the accompaniment
the bottom of the down stroke, the limiting sensation
of the movement cycle, coincides with the accented syllable of
the foot. It is not an unwarranted assumption that such a
fundamental accompaniment represents the fundamental movement
cycle of that rhythm.</p>

<p>During the present investigation several observers were
asked to determine at just what point in the fundamental movement
the unaccented syllable occurred, when the subject gave
a series of nonsense syllables. In the fundamental accompaniment
the excursion of the hand and arm was at least.4
meter. Four subjects were thus tested, and the results were
uniform in the case of all the simple types of unit groups.</p>

<p>In the case of the iamb the unaccented syllable occurs at
the top of the movement, at the very beginning of the contraction
phase (A, in Fig. 5).</p>

<p>In the case of the trochee the unaccented syllable occurs in
the first third of the relaxation phase (B).<span class="pagenum">[461]</span><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461"></a></p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the unaccented element of the
trochee comes at the earlier part of the relaxation phase, where
it must intensify the relaxation process, and tend to shorten the
total length of the cycle. This may be the reason for its
peculiar buoyant, vigorous and non-final character. On the
other hand the unaccented element of the iamb occurs at a point
where it may initiate and intensify the contraction, which gives
the limiting sensation; it is, therefore, more closely bound to the
limiting sensation, and has the character of intensifying the beat.
There is a similar contrast in the cases of the dactyl and
anap&aelig;st. The accented syllable of the dactyl is longest, and
the second unaccented syllable, the last in the group, is shortest.
The accented syllable of the anap&aelig;st is much longer in proportion
than that of the dactyl, and the unaccented syllables
are very short, and hence, very close to the accented syllable,
as compared with the dactyl.</p>

<p>In the case of the dactyl the first unaccented syllable in the
movement cycle occurs at the beginning of the relaxation
phase (B), in the same zone as the unaccented of the trochee.
The second unaccented syllable of the dactyl appears at the
beginning of the next contraction phase (A), in the zone of the
unaccented syllable of the iamb. The group seems a sort of
combination of the iamb and trochee, and has an element in
every possible zone of the movement cycle. Like the trochee
the dactyl is a non-final foot.</p>

<p>The unaccented syllables of the anap&aelig;st both occur at the
beginning of the contraction phase (A). They are both within
the zone of the unaccented syllable of the iamb. The group
seems an iamb with a duplicated unaccented syllable. It is
possible to form a unit group in nonsense syllables where the
unaccented syllable of the iamb shall be represented not by two
syllables, as in the anap&aelig;st, but by even three.</p>

<p>The anap&aelig;st and dactyl, if they correspond to this construction,
should show a decided difference as to the possibility of
prolonging the foot pause. The prolongation of the foot pause
would make the dactyl but a modified trochee.</p>

<p>It is significant that in poetry no other types of unit groups
are often recognized. The amphibrach, laid out on this scheme,
<span class="pagenum">[462]</span><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462"></a>would coincide with the dactyl, as there are but three possible
zones for foot elements: the zone of the limiting sensation
(always occupied by the accented syllable), the zone of the contraction
phase (occupied by the unaccented syllables of the iamb
and anap&aelig;st), and the zone of the relaxation phase (occupied
by the unaccented syllable of the trochee and the middle syllable
of the dactyl).</p>

<p>The simple sound series is fairly regular, because of its
cyclic and automatic character. It is not a matter of time estimation,
and the 'Taktgleichheit' is not observed with accuracy.
The primary requisite for the unit groups is that they shall be
<i>alike</i>, not that they shall be <i>equal</i>. The normal cycle with a
heavy accent is longer than the normal cycle with a lighter
accent, for the simple reason that it takes muscles longer to relax
from the tenser condition. Time is not mysteriously 'lost';
the objective difference is not noticed, simply because there are
no striking differences in the cycles to lead one to a time judgment.
Ebhardt's notion that the motor reaction interferes with
the time judgment, and that a small amount of time is needed
in the rhythmic series in which to make time judgments, is a
mere myth.</p>

<p>An unusual irregularity, like a 'lag,' is noted because of the
sense of strain and because other events supervene in the interval.
But such lags may be large without destroying the
rhythm; indeed c&aelig;sural and verse pauses are essential to a
rhythm, and in no sense rhythm-destroying. An unbroken
series of unit groups is an abstraction to which most forms of
apparatus have helped us. Between the extreme views of
Bolton<a name="FNanchor_24_125" id="FNanchor_24_125"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_24_125'>24</a> and Sidney Lanier,<a name="FNanchor_25_126" id="FNanchor_25_126"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_25_126'>25</a>who make regularity an essential
of the rhythm of verse, and Meumann, on the other hand, who
makes the meaning predominate over the rhythm, the choice
would fall with Meumann, if one must choose. Bolton comes
to the matter after an investigation in which regularity was a
characteristic of all the series. Lanier's constructions are in
musical terms, and for that very reason open to question. He
points out many subtle and interesting relationships, but that
verse can be formulated in terms of music is a theory which
stands or falls by experimental tests.</p>

<div class="tblexp"><p>(The first stanza was measured in the Harvard Laboratory. The last is
modified from Scripture's measurements of the gramophone record (1899). As
the scansion of the last is in doubt with Scripture, no totals of feet are given.)</p></div>

<p>In the cases given in the above table there is an irregularity
quite impossible to music.</p>

<p>In the movement cycle of the simple sounds there is a perfect
uniformity of the movements of the positive and negative
sets of muscles from unit group to unit group. But in verse,
the movements of the motor apparatus are very complicated.
Certain combinations require more time for execution; but if
this variation in the details of the movement does not break the
series of motor cues, or so delay the movements as to produce
a feeling of strain, the unit groups are felt to be alike. We
have no means of judging their temporal <i>equality</i>, even if we
cared to judge of it. It is a mistake, however, to say that time
relations ('quantity') play no part in modern verse, for the phases
of the movement cycle have certain duration relations which
can be varied only within limits.<span class="pagenum">[464]</span><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464"></a></p>

<p>Extreme caution is necessary in drawing conclusions as to
the nature of verse from work with scanned nonsense syllables
or with mechanical clicks. It is safe to say that verse is
rhythmic, and, if rhythm depends on a certain regularity of
movements, that verse will show such movements. It will of
course use the widest variation possible in the matter of accents,
lags, dynamic forms, and lengths of sonant and element depending
on emphasis. The character of the verse as it appears on
the page may not be the character of the verse as it is actually
read. The verses may be arbitrarily united or divided. But
in any simple, rhythmic series, like verse, it seems inevitable
that there shall be a pause at the end of the real verse, unless
some such device as rhyme is used for the larger phrasing.</p>

<p>There is a variety of repetitions in poetry. There may be
a vague, haunting recurrence of a word or phrase, without a
definite or symmetrical place in the structure.</p>

<p>Repetition at once attracts attention and tends to become a
structural element because of its vividness in the total effect.
There are two ways in which it may enter into the rhythmic
structure. It may become a well-defined refrain, usually of
more than one word, repeated at intervals and giving a sense of
recognition and possibly of completeness, or it may be so correlated
that the verses are bound together and occur in groups
or pairs. Rhyme is a highly specialized form of such recurrence.</p>

<p>The introduction of rhyme into verse must affect the verse
in two directions.</p>

<p>It makes one element in the time values, viz., the verse
pause, much more flexible and favors 'run on' form of verses;
it is an important factor in building larger unities; it correlates
verses, and contributes definite 'Gestaltqualit&auml;ten' which make
possible the recognition of structure and the control of the larger
movements which determine this structure. Thus it gives plasticity
and variety to the verse.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it limits the verse form in several directions.
The general dynamic relations and the individual accents
must conform to the types possible with rhyme. The expressional
changes of pitch, which constitute the 'melody,' or the<span class="pagenum">[465]</span><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465"></a>
'inflections' of the sentences, play an important part. The
dynamic and melodic phases of spoken verse which have important
relations to the rhyme are not determined by the mere
words. The verses may scan faultlessly, the lines may read
smoothly and be without harsh and difficult combinations, and
yet the total rhythmic effect may be indifferent or unpleasant.
When a critic dilates on his infallible detection of an indefinable
somewhat, independent of material aspects of the verse and
traceable to a mystic charm of 'thought,' it may very well be
that the unanalyzed thing lies in just such dynamic and melodic
conditions of rhythm and rhyme.</p>

<p>The most primitive characteristic of music is the <i>ensemble</i>.
Savage music is often little else than time-keeping. When the
social consciousness would express itself in speech or movement
in unison, some sort of automatic regulation is necessary.
This is the beginning of music. The free reading of verse
easily passes over into singing or chanting. When this happens,
the thing most noticeable in the new form is its regulated,
automatic and somewhat rigid character. It is stereotyped
throughout. Not only are the intervals and accents fixed, but
the pitch and quality changes are now definite, sustained and
recurrent. The whole sum of the motor processes of utterance
has become co&ouml;rdinated and regulated. Along with this precision
of all the movements comes a tendency to beat a new
rhythm. This accompanying rhythm is simpler and broader
in character; it is a kind of long swell on which the speech
movements ripple. This second rhythm may express itself in
a new movement of hand, head, foot or body; when it has become
more conscious, as in patting time to a dance or chant, it
develops complicated forms, and a third rhythm may appear beside
it, to mark the main stresses of the two processes. The
negro patting time for a dance beats the third fundamental
rhythm with his foot, while his hands pat an elaborate second
rhythm to the primary rhythm of the dancers.</p>

<p>The essential character of musical rhythm, as contrasted
with the rhythm of both simple sounds and of verse, is just this
co&ouml;rdination of a number of rhythms which move side by side.
This is the reason for the immense complexity and variety of
<span class="pagenum">[466]</span><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466"></a>musical rhythms. The processes check each other and furnish
a basis for a precision and elaborateness of rhythmical movement
in the individual parts which is quite impossible in a
simple rhythm.</p>

<p>Even when the concomitant rhythms are not expressed, as
in an unaccompanied solo, an accompaniment of some sort is
present in the motor apparatus, and contributes its effect to the
consciousness. This regulation of the movement by the coincidence
of several rhythms is the cause of the striking regularity
of the temporal relations. At some points in the musical
series the several movement cycles may appear in the same
phase, and at these points the same irregularities as in verse are
possible, as in the case of pauses at the ends of periods and the
irregularities of phrasing. It is evident in cases of expressional
variations of tempo that a single broad rhythm is dominating
and serving as a cue for the other more elaborate rhythmic
processes, instead of being regulated by them.<span class="pagenum">[467]</span><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467"></a></p>

<h2><a name="AES3" id="AES3"></a>STUDIES IN SYMMETRY.<a name="FNanchor_1_127" id="FNanchor_1_127"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_1_127'>1</a></h2>

<h4>BY ETHEL D. PUFFER.</h4>


<h3>I. THE PROBLEMS OF SYMMETRY.</h3>

<p>The problem of &aelig;sthetic satisfaction in symmetrical forms
is easily linked with the well-known theory of 'sympathetic reproduction.'
If there exists an instinctive tendency to imitate
visual forms by motor impulses, the impulses suggested by the
symmetrical form would seem to be especially in harmony with
the system of energies in our bilateral organism, and this harmony
may be the basis of our pleasure. But we should then
expect that all space arrangements which deviate from complete
symmetry, and thus suggest motor impulses which do not correspond
to the natural bilateral type would fail to give &aelig;sthetic
pleasure. Such, however, is not the case. Non-symmetrical
arrangements of space are often extremely pleasing.</p>

<p>This contradiction disappears if we are able to show that the
apparently non-symmetrical arrangement contains a hidden
symmetry, and that all the elements of that arrangement contribute
to bring about just that bilateral type of motor impulses
which is characteristic of geometrical symmetry. The question
whether or not this is the fact makes the leading problem of this
paper, and the answer to it must throw light on the value of the
theory itself.</p>

<p>An exhaustive treatment of our question would thus divide
itself into two parts; the first dealing with real (or geometrical)<span class="pagenum">[468]</span><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468"></a>
symmetry, the second with apparent asymmetry; the first seeking
to show that there is a real &aelig;sthetic pleasure in geometrical
symmetry, and that this pleasure is indeed based on the harmony
of the motor impulses suggested by symmetry, with the
natural motor impulses of the human organism; the second
seeking to show in what manner &aelig;sthetically pleasing but
asymmetrical arrangements conform to the same principles.
Within these two groups of problems two general types of investigation
are seen to be required; experiment, and the analysis
of &aelig;sthetic objects.</p>

<p>The main question, as stated above, is of course whether
the theory can explain our pleasure in arrangements which
are completely or partly symmetrical. It is, however, an indispensible
preliminary to this question, to decide whether the
pleasure in symmetrical arrangements of space is indeed immediate
and original. If it were shown to be a satisfaction of expectation,
bred partly from the observation of symmetrical
forms in nature, partly from the greater convenience of symmetrical
objects in daily use, the whole question of a psychophysical
explanation would have no point. If no original
&aelig;sthetic pleasure is felt, the problem would be transformed to
a demand for the explanation of the various ways in which practical
satisfaction is given by symmetrical objects and arrangements.
The logical order, then, for our investigation would be:
First, the appearance of symmetry in the productions of primitive
life, as a (debatable) &aelig;sthetic phenomenon emerging from pre-&aelig;sthetic
conditions; secondly, the experimental study of real
symmetry; thirdly, the analysis of geometrical symmetry in
art, especially in painting and architecture, by means of which
the results of the preceding studies could be checked and confirmed.
Having once established a theory of the &aelig;sthetic significance
of real symmetry, we should next have to examine
asymmetrical, beautiful objects with reference to the relation of
their parts to a middle line; to isolate the elements which suggest
motor impulses; to find out how far it is possible to establish
a system of substitution of these psychological factors and how
far such substitution takes place in works of art&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, to what
extent a substitutional symmetry or balance is found in pleasing
<span class="pagenum">[469]</span><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469"></a>arrangements. These investigations, again, would fall into the
two groups of experiment and analysis. The products of civilized
art are too complicated to admit of the complete analysis and
isolation of elements necessary to establish such a system of substitution
of psychological factors as we seek. From suggestions,
however, obtained from pleasing asymmetrical arrangements,
first, isolated elements may be treated experimentally, and secondly,
the results checked and confirmed by works of art.</p>

<p>With regard to the study of objects without a natural or
suggested middle line, as for instance sculpture, many types of
architecture, landscapes, gardens, room-arrangements, etc., we
may fitly consider it as a corollary to the study of asymmetrical
objects with artificial limits which do suggest a middle. If we
find, by the study of them, that a system of substitution of psychological
factors does obtain, the whole field can be covered
by the theory already propounded, and its application extended
to the minutest details. The hypothesis, having been so far
confirmed, may be then easily applied to the field of asymmetrical
objects without a natural middle line.</p>

<p>The set of problems here suggested to the student of symmetry
will not be fully followed out in this paper. The experimental
treatment of geometrical symmetry, the analysis of the
completely symmetrical products of civilized art, and the analysis
of all forms of asymmetry except asymmetry in pictures will be
omitted. If, however, the fact of an original &aelig;sthetic feeling for
symmetry is established by the study of primitive art, and the
theory of the balance of motor impulses through the substitution
of factors is established by the experimental treatment of isolated
elements, and further confirmed by the analysis of pictures, the
general argument may be taken as sufficiently supported. This
paper, then, will contain three sections: an introductory one on
symmetry in primitive art, and two main sections, one on experiments
in substitutional symmetry, and one on substitutional symmetry
or balance in pictures.</p>

<h3>II. SYMMETRY IN PRIMITIVE ART.</h3>

<p>The question which this section will attempt to answer is
this: Is there in primitive art an original and immediate &aelig;sthetic
<span class="pagenum">[470]</span><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470"></a>feeling for symmetry? This question depends on two
others which must precede it: To what extent does symmetry
actually appear in primitive art? and, How far must its presence
be accounted for by other than &aelig;sthetic demands?</p>

<p>For the purpose of this inquiry the word <i>primitive</i> may be
taken broadly as applying to the products of savage and half-savage
peoples of to-day, as well as to those of prehistoric races.
The expression <i>primitive art</i>, also, requires a word of explanation.
The primitive man seldom makes purely ornamental
objects, but, on the other hand, most of his articles of daily use
have an ornamental character. We have to consider primitive
art, therefore, as represented in the form and ornamentation of
all these objects, constituting practically an household inventory,
with the addition of certain drawings and paintings which do
not appear to serve a definite practical end. These last, however,
constitute only a small proportion of the material.</p>

<p>The method of the following outline treatment will be to
deduct from the object under consideration those symmetrical
elements which seem to be directly traceable to non-&aelig;sthetic
influences; such elements as are not thus to be accounted for
must be taken as evidence of a direct pleasure in, and desire
for symmetry on the part of primitive man. These possible
non-&aelig;sthetic influences may be provisionally suggested to be
the technical conditions of construction, the greater convenience
and hence desirability of symmetrical objects for practical use,
and the symmetrical character of natural forms which were
imitated.</p>

<p>The first great group of objects is given in primitive architecture.
Here is found almost complete unanimity of design,
the conical, hemispherical or beehive form being well-nigh
universal. The hut of the Hottentots, a cattle-herding, half-nomadic
people, is a good type of this. A circle of flexible
staves is stuck into the ground, bent together and fastened
at the top, and covered with skins. But this is the form of
shelter constructed with the greatest ease, suitable to the
demands of elastic materials, boughs, twigs, reeds, etc., and
giving the greatest amount of space with the least material.
There are, indeed, a few examples of the rectangular form of
<span class="pagenum">[471]</span><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471"></a>dwelling among various primitive races, but these seem to be
more or less open to explanation by the theory advanced by
Mr. V. Mendeleff, of the U.S. Bureau of Ethnology. &quot;In
his opinion the rectangular form of architecture which succeeds
the type under discussion, must have resulted from the circular
form by the bringing together within a limited area of many
houses.... This partition would naturally be built straight
as a two-fold measure of economy.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_2_128" id="FNanchor_2_128"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_2_128'>2</a> This opinion is confirmed
by Mr. Cushing's observations among the Zu&ntilde;i villages, where
the pueblos have circular forms on the outskirts. Thus the
shape of the typical primitive dwelling is seen to be fully accounted
for as the product of practical considerations alone. It
may therefore be dismissed as offering no especial points of
interest for this inquiry.</p>

<p>Next in the order of primitive development are the arts
of binding and weaving. The stone axe or arrow-head, for
example, was bound to a wooden staff, and had to be lashed with
perfect evenness,<a name="FNanchor_3_129" id="FNanchor_3_129"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_3_129'>3</a> and when in time the material and method of
fastening changed, the geometrical forms of this careful binding
continued to be engraved at the juncture of blade and
handle of various implements. It should be noted, however,
that these binding-patterns, in spite of their superfluous character,
remained symmetrical.</p>

<p>On the great topic of symmetry in weaving, monographs
could be written. Here it is sufficient to recall<a name="FNanchor_4_130" id="FNanchor_4_130"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_4_130'>4</a> that the absolutely
necessary technique of weaving in all its various forms
of interlacing, plaiting, netting, embroidering, etc., implies order,
uniformity, and symmetry. The chance introduction of a thread
or withe of a different color, brings out at once an ordered pattern
in the result; the crowding together or pressing apart of
elements, a different alternation of the woof, a change in the
order of intersection, all introduce changes by the natural necessities
of construction which have the effect of purpose. So
far, then, as the simple weaving is concerned, the &aelig;sthetic
<span class="pagenum">[472]</span><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472"></a>demand for symmetry may be discounted. While it may be
operative, the forms can be explained by the necessities of construction,
and we have no right to assume an &aelig;sthetic motive.</p>

<p>The treatment of human and animal forms in weaving is,
however, indicative of a direct pleasure in symmetry. The
human form appears almost exclusively (much schematized) <i>en
face</i>. When in profile, as for instance in Mexican and South
American work, it is doubled&mdash;that is, two figures are seen face
to face. Animal figures, on the other hand, are much used as
row-ornaments in profile.<a name="FNanchor_5_131" id="FNanchor_5_131"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_5_131'>5</a> It would seem that only the linear
conception of the row or band with its suggestions of movement
in one direction, justified the use of profile (<i>e.g.</i>, in Peruvian
woven stuffs), since it is almost always seen under those conditions,
indicating that a limited rectangular space is felt as satisfactorily
filled only by a symmetrical figure.<a name="FNanchor_6_132" id="FNanchor_6_132"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_6_132'>6</a> Moreover, and
still more confirmatory of this theory, even these row-pattern
profiles are immensely distorted toward symmetry, and every
'degradation' of form, to use Professor Haddon's term, is in
the direction of symmetry. (See Fig. 1.)</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="./images/489-fig1.png" width="640" height="84" alt="Fig. 1." title="" /></div>

<p>The shape of primitive pottery is conditioned by the following
influences: The shapes of utensils preceding clay,
such as skins, gourds, shells, etc., which have been imitated,
the forms of basket models, and the conditions of construction
(formation by the hands). For all these reasons, most of these
shapes are circular. The only (in the strict sense) symmetrical
shapes found are of unmistakably animal origin, and it is interesting
to notice the gradual return of these to the eurhythmic
form; puma, bird, frog, etc., gradually changing into head,
tail and leg excrescences, and then handles and nodes (rectangular panels),
<span class="pagenum">[473]</span><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473"></a>upon a round bowl or jar L, as shown in the
figures. In fact, in ancient American pottery,<a name="FNanchor_7_133" id="FNanchor_7_133"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_7_133'>7</a> at least, all the
symmetrical ornamentations can be traced to the opposition of
head and tail, and the sides between them, of these animal forms.
But beyond this there is no degradation of the broad outline of
the design. The head and tail, and sides, become respectively
handles and nodes&mdash;but the symmetry becomes only more
and more emphasized. And as in the case of textiles, the ornaments
of the rectangular spaces given by the nodes are strikingly
symmetrical. Many of these are from animal motives,
and nearly always heads are turned back over the body, tails
exaggerated, or either or both doubled, to get a symmetrical
effect. Although much of the symmetrical ornament, again, is
manifestly from textile models, its symmetrical character is so
carefully preserved against the suggestions of the circular form
that a direct pleasure in its symmetry may be inferred. (See
Figs. 2-7.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[474]</span><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474"></a>The subject of drawing can be here only touched upon,
but the results of study go to show, in general, two main directions
of primitive expression: pictorial representation, aiming
at truth of life, and symbolic ornament. The drawings of
Australians, Hottentots and Bushmen, and the carvings of the
Esquimaux and of the prehistoric men of the reindeer period
show remarkable vigor and naturalness; while the ornamentation
of such tribes as the South Sea Islanders has a richness
and formal beauty that compare favorably with the decoration
of civilized contemporaries. But these two types of art do not
always keep pace with each other. The petroglyphs of the
North American Indians<a name="FNanchor_8_134" id="FNanchor_8_134"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_8_134'>8</a> exhibit the greatest irregularity,
while their tattooing is extremely regular and symmetrical.
The Brazilian savage <a name="FNanchor_9_135" id="FNanchor_9_135"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_9_135'>9</a> draws freehand in a very lively and
grotesque manner, but his patterns are regular and carefully
developed. Again, not all have artistic talents in the same
direction. Dr. Schurtz, in his 'Ornamentik der Aino,'<a name="FNanchor_10_136" id="FNanchor_10_136"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_10_136'>10</a> says:
&quot;There are people who show a decided impulse for the direct
imitation of nature, and especially for the representation of
events of daily life, as dancing, hunting, fishing, etc. It is,
however, remarkable that a real system of ornamentation is
scarcely ever developed from pictorial representations of this
kind; that, in fact, the people who carry out these copies of
everyday scenes with especial preference, are in general less
given to covering their utensils with a rich ornamentive decoration.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_11_137" id="FNanchor_11_137"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_11_137'>11</a>
Drawing and ornament, as the products of different
tendencies, may therefore be considered separately.</p>

<p>The reason for the divergence of drawing and ornament
is doubtless the original motive of ornamentation, which is
found in the clan or totem ideas. Either to invoke protection
<span class="pagenum">[475]</span><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475"></a>or to mark ownership, the totem symbol appears on all instruments
and utensils; it has been shown, indeed, that practically
all primitive ornament is based on totemic motives.<a name="FNanchor_12_138" id="FNanchor_12_138"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_12_138'>12</a> Now,
since a very slight suggestion of the totem given by its recognized
symbol is sufficient for the initiated, the extreme of conventionalization
and degradation of patterns is allowable, and is
observed to take place. The important point to be noted in
this connection is, however, that all these changes are toward
symmetry. The most striking examples might be indefinitely
multiplied, and are to be found in the appended references
(see Figs. 8 and 9).</p>

<p>We may distinguish here, also, between the gradual disintegration
and degradation of pattern toward symmetry, as seen
in the examples just given, and the deliberate distortion of figures
for a special purpose. This is strikingly shown in the
decorative art of the Indians of the North Pacific coast. They
systematically represent their totem animals&mdash;their only decorative
motives&mdash;as split in symmetrical sections, and opened out
flat on the surface which is to be covered<a name="FNanchor_13_139" id="FNanchor_13_139"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_13_139'>13</a> (see Fig. 11). Dr.<span class="pagenum">[476]</span><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476"></a>
Boas argues that their purpose is to get in all the received symbols,
or to show the whole animal, but, however this may be,
every variation introduces symmetry even where it is difficult to
do so, as in the case, for instance, of bracelets, hat-brims, etc.
(Fig. 10). This may in some cases be due to the symmetrical
suggestions of the human body in tattooing,<a name="FNanchor_14_140" id="FNanchor_14_140"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_14_140'>14</a> but it must be so in
comparatively few.</p>

<p>The primitive picture has for its object not only to impart
information, but to excite the very definite pleasure of recognition
of a known object. All explorers agree in their accounts
of the savage's delight in his own na&iuml;ve efforts at picture making.
All such drawings show in varying degrees the same
characteristics; first of all, an entire lack of symmetry. In a
really great number of examples, including drawings and
<span class="pagenum">[477]</span><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477"></a>picture-writing from all over the world, I have not found one
which showed an attempt at symmetrical arrangement. Secondly,
great life and movement, particularly in the drawings of
animals. Thirdly, an emphasis of the typical characteristics, the
logical marks, amounting sometimes to caricature. The primitive
man draws to tell a story, as children do. He gives with
real power what interests him, and puts in what he knows ought
to be there, even if it is not seen, but he is so engrossed by his
interest in the imitated object as to neglect entirely its relation
to a background.</p>

<p>Now, this very antithesis of ornament and picture is enlightening
as to the dawn of &aelig;sthetic feeling, and the strongest
confirmation of our hypothesis of an original impulse to symmetry
in art. In the ornamentation of objects the content or
meaning of the design is already supplied by the merest hint of
the symbol which is the practical motive of all ornamentation.
The savage artist need, therefore, concern himself no more
about it, and the form of his design is free to take whatever
shape is demanded either by the conditions of technique and
the surface to be ornamented, or by the natural &aelig;sthetic impulse.
We have found that technical conditions account for
only a small part of the observed symmetry in pattern, and
the inference to a natural tendency to symmetry is clear. Pictorial
<span class="pagenum">[478]</span><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478"></a>representation, on the other hand, is enjoyed by the
primitive man merely as an imitation, of which he can say,
'This is that animal'&mdash;to paraphrase Aristotle's Poetics. He
is thus constrained to reproduce the form as it shows meaning,
and to ignore it as form, or as his natural motor impulses would
make it.</p>

<p>To sum up the conclusions reached by this short survey of
the field of primitive art, it is clear that much of the symmetry
appearing in primitive art is due (1) to the conditions of construction,
as in the form of dwellings, binding-patterns, weaving
and textile patterns generally; (2) to convenience in use,
as in the shapes of spears, arrows, knives, two-handled baskets
and jars; (3) to the imitation of animal forms, as in the shapes
of pottery, etc. On the other hand (1) a very great deal of
symmetrical ornament maintains itself <i>against</i> the suggestions
of the shape to which it is applied, as the ornaments of baskets,
pottery, and all rounded objects; and (2) all distortion, disintegration,
degradation of pattern-motives, often so marked
as all but to destroy their meaning, is in the direction of geometrical
symmetry. In short it is impossible to account for more
than a small part of the marked symmetry of primitive art by
non-&aelig;sthetic influences, and we are therefore forced to conclude
an original tendency to create symmetry, and to take
pleasure in it. A strong negative confirmation of this is given,
as noted above, by the utter lack of symmetry of the only
branch of art in which the primitive man is fully preoccupied
with meaning to the neglect of shape; and by the contrast of
this with those branches of art in which attention to meaning is
at its minimum.</p>

<p>The question put at the beginning of this section must thus
be answered affirmatively. There is evidence of an original
&aelig;sthetic pleasure in symmetry.</p>


<h3>III. EXPERIMENTS IN SUBSTITUTIONAL SYMMETRY.</h3>

<h4><i>A. Method of Experiment.</i></h4>

<p>A certain degree of original &aelig;sthetic pleasure in symmetry
may be considered to have been established by the preceding
section, and, without considering further the problems of real or
<span class="pagenum">[479]</span><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479"></a>geometrical symmetry, it may now be asked whether the
pleasure aroused by the form of asymmetrical objects is not at
bottom also pleasure in symmetry; whether, in other words,
a kind of substitution of factors does not obtain in such objects,
which brings about a psychological state similar to that produced
by real symmetry.</p>

<p>The question what these substituted factors may be can perhaps
be approached by a glance at a few pictures which are accepted
as beautiful in form, although not geometrically symmetrical.
Let us take, for instance, several simple pictures
from among the well-known altar-pieces, all representing the
same subject, the <i>Madonna Enthroned</i> with <i>Infant Christ</i>, and
all of generally symmetrical outline. It seems, then, reasonable
to assume that if the variations from symmetry show constantly
recurring tendencies, they represent the chief factors in
such a substitutional symmetry or balance, supposing it to exist.
The following pictures are thus treated in detail, M. denoting
Madonna; C., Child; and Cn., Central Line. The numbers
refer to the collection of reproductions used exclusively in this
investigation, and further described in section IV.</p>

<p>1. 56, Martin Sch&ouml;ngauer: <i>Madonna in Rose-arbor.</i> M.
is seated exactly in Cn., C. on Right, turning to Right. M.
turns to Left, and her long hair and draperies form one long
unbroken line down to Left lower corner. All other details
symmetrical.</p>

<p>2. 867, Titian: <i>Madonna</i>. The picture is wider than it is
high. M. stands slightly to Right of Cn.; C. on Right. Both
turn slightly to Left, and the drapery of M. makes a long sweep
to Left. Also a deep perspective occupies the whole Left field.</p>

<p>3. 248, Raphael: <i>Madonna</i> (The Bridgewater Madonna).
M. sits in Cn., turning to Left; C. lies across her lap, head to
Left, but his face turned up to Right, and all the lines of his
body tending sharply down to Right.</p>

<p>In 1, all the elements of the picture are symmetrical except
the position of C. on the Right, and the long flowing line to
Left. In 2, there is a slightly greater variation. The mass of
the figures is to Right, and the C. entirely over against the deep
perspective and the flowing line on the Left, and the direction
<span class="pagenum">[480]</span><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480"></a>of both faces toward that side. In 3, the greater part of C.'s
figure on Left is opposed by the direction of his lines and
movement to Right. Thus these three pictures, whether or not
they are considered as presenting a balance, at least show
several well-defined factors which detach themselves from the
general symmetrical scheme. (1) Interest in C. is opposed by
outward-pointing line; (2) greater mass, by outward-pointing
line, deep vista, and direction of attention; and (3) again
interest by direction of line and suggestion of movement.</p>

<p>This analysis of several &aelig;sthetically pleasing but asymmetrical
arrangements of space strongly suggests that the elements
of large size, deep perspective, suggested movement, and
intrinsic interest are in some way equivalent in their power to
arouse those motor impulses which we believe to constitute the
basis of &aelig;sthetic response. It is the purpose of these experiments
to follow up the lines of these suggestions, reducing them
to their simplest forms and studying them under exact conditions.</p>

<p>But before describing the instruments and methods of this
experimental treatment, I wish to speak of the articles on
the '&AElig;sthetics of Simple Form,' published as Studies from
the Harvard Psychological Laboratory, by Dr. Edgar Pierce.<a name="FNanchor_15_141" id="FNanchor_15_141"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_15_141'>15</a>
These articles, sub-entitled 'Symmetry' and 'The Functions
of the Elements' seem at first sight to anticipate the discussions
of this paper; but a short analysis shows that while
they point in the same direction, they nevertheless deal with
quite different questions and in a different manner. In the
statement of his problem, indeed, Dr. Pierce is apparently
treading the same path.</p>

<p>He says: &quot;Can a feeling of symmetry, that is, of &aelig;sthetical
equality of the two halves, remain where the two sides are
not geometrically identical; and if so, what are the conditions
under which this can result&mdash;what variations of one side seem
&aelig;sthetically equal to the variations of the other side?&quot; Some
preliminary experiments resulted in the conclusion that an unsymmetrical
and yet pleasing arrangement of a varied content
rests on the pleasure in unity, thus shutting out the Golden<span class="pagenum">[481]</span><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481"></a>
Section choice, which depends on the pleasure in variety.
That is, the choices made will not in general follow the golden
section, but 'when the figure consists of two halves, the pleasure
must be a feeling of &aelig;sthetical symmetry.'</p>

<p>The final experiments were arrangements of lines and simple
figures on a square, black background in which the center
was marked by a white vertical line with a blue or a red line
on each side. On one side of these central lines a line was
fixed; and the subject had to place on the other side lines and
simple figures of different sizes and different colors, so as to
balance the fixed line. The results showed that lines of greater
length, or figures of greater area must be put nearer the center
than shorter or smaller ones&mdash;'A short line must be farther
than a long one, a narrow farther than a wide, a line farther
than a square; an empty interval must be larger than one filled,
and so on.' And for colors, &quot;blue, maroon and green, the
dark colors, are the farthest out; white, red and orange, the
bright colors, are nearest the center. This means that a dark
color must be farther out than a bright one to compensate for a
form on the other side. The brightness of an object is then a
constant substitute for its distance in satisfying our feeling of
symmetry.&quot;</p>

<p>Now from these conclusions two things are clear. By his
extremely emphasized central line, and his explicit question to
the subjects, 'Does this balance?' the author has excluded
any other point of view than that of mechanical balance. His
central fulcrum is quite overpowering. Secondly, his inquiry
has dealt only with size and color, leaving the questions of
interest, movement, and perspective untouched. But just the
purpose of this experimental study is to seek for the different
and possibly conflicting tendencies in composition, and to approximate
to the conditions given in pictorial art. It is evident,
I think, that the two studies on symmetry will not trespass
on each other's territory. The second paper of Dr. Pierce,
on 'The Functions of the Elements,' deals entirely with the relation
of horizontal and vertical positions of the &aelig;sthetic object
and of the subject to &aelig;sthetic judgments, and has therefore no
bearing on this paper.<span class="pagenum">[482]</span><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482"></a></p>

<p>For his apparatus Dr. Pierce used a surface of black cloth
stretched over black rubber, 1 m. square. Now an investigation
which is to deal with complicated and varied relations, resembling
those of pictures, demands an instrument resembling them
also in the shape of the background. A rectangle 600 mm. broad
by 400 mm. high seemed to meet this requirement better than
the square of Dr. Pierce. Other parts, also, of his instrument
seemed unfitted for our purpose. The tin, 5 cm. broad and
confined to the slits across the center of the square, gave
not enough opportunity for movement in a vertical direction,
while the scale at the back was very inconvenient for reading.
To supply these lacks, a scale graduated in millimeters
was attached on the lower edge of the board, between a double
track in which ran slides, the positions of which could be
read on the scale. To the slides were attached long strips
of tin covered with black cloth. On these strips figures glued
to small clamps or clasps could be slipped up or down; this
arrangement of co&ouml;rdinates made it possible to place a figure
in any spot of the whole surface without bringing the hands
into the field of view. The experiments were made in a dark
room, in which the apparatus was lighted by an electric globe
veiled by white paper and hung above and behind the head
of the subject, so as not to be seen by him and to cast no
shadow: in this soft light of course the black movable strips
disappeared against the black background. A gray paper
frame an inch and a half wide was fitted to the black rectangle
to throw it up against the black depths of the dark room&mdash;thus
giving in all details the background of a picture to be composed.</p>

<p>The differences in method between the two sets of experiments
were fundamental. In Dr. Pierce's experiments the
figures were pulled from one side to the other of the half-square
in question, and the subject was asked to stop them where he
liked; in those of the writer the subject himself moved the
slides back and forth until a position was found &aelig;sthetically
satisfactory. The subject was never asked, Does this balance?
He was indeed requested to abstract from the idea of balance,
but to choose that position which was the most immediately
<span class="pagenum">[483]</span><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483"></a>pleasing for its own sake, and so far as possible detached from
associations.</p>

<p>I have said that Dr. Pierce intentionally accentuated the
center. The conditions of pictorial composition suggest in general
the center only by the rectangular frame. Most of my experiments
were, therefore, made without any middle line; some
were repeated with a middle line of fine white silk thread, for
the purpose of ascertaining the effect of the enhanced suggestion
of the middle line.</p>

<p>But the chief difference came in the different treatment of
results. Dr. Pierce took averages, whereas the present writer
has interpreted individual results. Now, suppose that one tendency
led the subject to place the slide at 50 and another to place
it at 130 mm. from the center. The average of a large number
of such choices would be 90&mdash;a position very probably disagreeable
in every way. For such an investigation it was evident
that interpretation of individual results was the only
method possible, except where it could be conclusively shown
that the subjects took one and only one point of view. They
were always encouraged to make a second choice if they wished
to do so, as it often happened that one would say: 'I like both
of these ways very much.' Of course, individual testimony
would be of the highest importance, and a general grouping
into classes and indication of the majority tendency would be
the only way to treat the results statistically. And indeed in
carrying out the experiments this caution was found absolutely
necessary. In all but one or two of the sections, the taking of
averages would have made the numerical results absolutely
unintelligible. Only the careful study of the individual case,
comparison of various experiments on the same person to find
personal tendencies, and comparison of the different tendencies,
could give valuable results for the theory of symmetry.</p>

<p>The first question to be taken up was the influence of right
and left positions on choice. A long series of experiments was
undertaken with a line 80&times;10 mm. on one side and a line
160&times;10 mm. on the other, in which the positions of these were
reversed, and each in turn taken as fixed and variable, with a
view to determining the effect of right and left positions. No
<span class="pagenum">[484]</span><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484"></a>definite conclusions emerged; and in the following experiments,
most of which have been made for both right and left positions,
the results will be treated as if made for one side alone, and,
where averages are taken, will be considered as indifferently
left or right.</p>

<p>The experiments of Dr. Pierce were made for only one position
of the fixed line&mdash;at 12 cm. distance from the center.
The characteristic of the following experiments is their reference
to all positions of the fixed line. For instance a fixed line,
10 cm. in length at 12 cm. distance from the center, might be
balanced by a line 5 cm. in length at 20 cm. distance. But
would the distance be in the same proportion for a given distance
of the fixed line of say 20 or 25 cm.? It is clear that
only a progressive series of positions of the fixed line would
suggest the changes in points of view or tendencies of choice of
the subject. Accordingly, for all the experiments the fixed line
or other object was placed successively at distances of 20, 40,
60 mm., etc., from the center; or at 40, 80 mm., etc., according
to the character of the object, and for each of these fixed
points the subject made one or two choices. Only an understanding
of the direction in which the variable series moved
gave in many cases an explanation for the choice.</p>

<p>Each choice, it should be added, was itself the outcome of
a long series of trials to find the most pleasing position. Thus,
each subject made only about ten choices in an hour, each of
which, as it appears in the tables, represents a large number of
approximations.</p>


<h4><i>B. Experiments on Size.</i></h4>

<p>I have said that different tendencies or types of choice in
arrangement appeared. It will be convenient in the course of
explaining in detail the method of experiment, to discuss at the
same time the meaning of these types of choice.</p>

<p>From analysis of the pictures, the simplest suggestion of
balance appeared in the setting off against each other of objects
of different sizes;&mdash;an apparent equivalence of a large object
near the center with a small object far from the center;
thus inevitably suggesting the relations of the mechanical balance,
or lever, in which the heavy short arm balances the light
<span class="pagenum">[485]</span><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485"></a>long arm. This was also the result of Dr. Pierce's experiments
for one position of his fixed line. The experiments which
follow, however, differ in some significant points from this
result. The instrument used was the one described in the preceding
section. On one side, in the middle of the vertical strip,
was placed the 'fixed' line, denoted by F., and the subject
moved the 'variable' line, denoted by V., until he found the
arrangement &aelig;sthetically pleasing. The experimenter alone
placed F. at the given reading, and read off the position of V.
After the choice F. was placed at the next interval, V. was
again tried in different positions, and so on. In the following
tables the successive positions of F. are given in the left column,
reading downward, and the corresponding positions of V. in
the right column. The different choices are placed together,
but in case of any preference the second choice is indicated.
The measurements are always in millimeters. Thus, F. 40,
V. 60, means that F. is 40 mm. to one side of the center, and
V. 60 mm. to the opposite side. F. 80&times;10, V. 160&times;10,
means that the white cardboard strips 80 mm.&times;10 mm., etc.,
are used. The minus sign prefixed to a reading means that
the variable was placed on the side of the fixed line. An X
indicates &aelig;sthetic dislike&mdash;refusal to choose. An asterisk (*)
indicates a second choice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[486]</span><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486"></a>Now, on Dr. Pierce's theory, the variable in the first set
should be nearer the center, since it is twice the size of the
fixed line;&mdash;but the choices V. 120, 166, 130 for F. 40; V.
110, 104, 102, 126 for F. 80; V. 128 for F. 120; V. 196 for
F. 160; V. 230, 220 for F. 200, show that other forces are at
work. If these variations from the expected were slight, or if
the presence of second choices did not show a certain opposition
or contrast between the two positions, they might disappear
in an average. But the position of F. 40, over against V. 120,
166, 130, is evidently not a chance variation. Still more striking
are the variations for I. (<i>b</i>). Here we should expect the
variable, being smaller, to be farther from the center. But for
F. 40, we have V. 27, 34; for F. 80, all nearer but two; for
F. 120, V. 60, 56, 48, 82, 70; for F. 160, V. 29, 74, 16, 77,
138, and for F. 200, V. 96, 36, 25, 36, 177&mdash;while several
positions on the same side of the center as the constant show a
point of view quite irreconcilable with mechanical balance.</p>

<p>Here the variable should supposedly be the farther out; but
we have V. 58, 20 for F. 40-60; V. 48, 40, 56 for F. 60; V.
64, 70, 87 for F. 80; no larger choice for F. 100-120; indeed,
from this point on everything nearer, and very much nearer.
We can trace in these cases, more clearly perhaps than in the
preceding, the presence of definite tendencies. <i>O</i> and <i>P</i>, from
positions in accord with the mechanical theory, approach the
center rapidly; while <i>C</i> is seldom 'mechanical,' but very slowly
recedes from the center. The large number of refusals to
choose assures us that the subjects demand a definitely pleasant
arrangement&mdash;in other words, that every choice is the expression
of a deliberate judgment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[487]</span><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487"></a>Taking again the experiments 1. (a) and 1. (b), and grouping
the results for nine subjects, <i>C</i>, <i>O</i>, <i>A</i>, <i>S</i>, <i>H</i>, <i>G</i>, <i>D</i>, and <i>P</i>,
we obtain the following general types of choice. The experiments
were repeated by each subject, so that we have eighteen
records for each position. I should note here that preliminary
experiments showed that near the frame the threshold of difference
of position was 10 mm., or more, while near the center it
was 4 or 5 mm.; that is, arrangements were often judged symmetrically
equal which really differed by from 4 to 10 mm., according
as they were near to or far from the center. In grouping
types of choice, therefore, choices lying within these limits
will be taken as belonging to the same type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[488]</span><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488"></a>On comparing the different groups, we find that in 1 and 2
there is a decided preference for a position somewhat less than
half way between center and frame&mdash;more sharply marked for
1 than for 2. From 3 onward there is a decided preference
for the mechanical arrangement, which would bring the larger
strip nearer. Besides this, however, there are groups of variations,
some very near the center, others approaching to symmetry.
The maintenance of geometrical symmetry at a pretty constant
ratio is to be noted; as also the presence of positions on the
same side of the center as the fixed line. Before discussing the
significance of these groups we may consider the results of
Experiment II. (F. double line 80&times;10, V. single line 80&times;10)
without giving complete lists.</p>

<p>We notice therein, first of all, the practical disappearance
of the symmetrical choice; for F. 40-60, 60-80, 80-100, a
tendency, decreasing, however, with distance from the center,
to the mechanical arrangement; for F. 100-120, and all the
rest, not one mechanical choice, and the positions confined
almost entirely to the region 35-75. In some cases, however,
the mechanical choice for (1) 40-80, (2) 60-80, was one of two,
<i>e.g.</i>, we have for (1) 20 and 138, for (3) 70 and 162; in the
last two cases the mechanical being the second choice.</p>

<p>Now the reversals of the mechanical choice occur for Exp.
I. in 1 and 2 (F. 40 and F. 80); that is, when the small fixed
line is near the center, the larger variable is distant. For Exp.
II. the reversals, which are much more marked, occur in all
cases <i>beyond</i> F. 40, F. 60 and F. 80; that is, when the double
constant line is far from the center, the single variable approaches.
If the mechanical theory prevailed, we should have
in Exp. I. the lines together in the center, and in Exp. II. both
near the fringe.</p>

<p>From the individual testimony, based both on I. (<i>a</i>) and I.
(<i>b</i>), it appears that subject <i>M</i> is perfectly uniform in mechanical
choice when the fixed line is the small line&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> when it
moves out, the larger is placed near the center; but when the
conditions of mechanical choice would demand that, as the
larger fixed line moves out, the small variable one should move
out farther, he regularly chooses the reverse. Nevertheless,
<span class="pagenum">[489]</span><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489"></a>he insists that in just these cases he has a feeling of equilibrium.</p>

<p><i>A</i> also takes the mechanical choice as the small fixed line
goes farther from the center; but when the fixed line is large
and leaves the center, he reverses the mechanical choice&mdash;evidently
because it would take the small line too far out. As he
says, 'he is always disturbed by too large a black space in the
center.'</p>

<p><i>G</i> almost always takes the mechanical choice;&mdash;in one
whole set of experiments, in which the fixed line is the large
line, he reverses regularly.</p>

<p><i>H</i> takes for F. (80&times;10) the mechanical choice only for the
positions F. 160 and F. 200&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, only when F. is very far
from the center and he wishes V. (160&times;10) nearer. For F.
(160&times;10) he makes six such choices out of ten, but for positions
F. 160 and F. 200 he has V. 44, 65 and 20.</p>

<p><i>S</i> takes for F. (160&times;10) at F. 120, V. 185 and-70; says
of V. 185, which is also his choice for F. (160&times;10) at F. 80,
'I cannot go out further, because it is so hard to take in the
whole field.' For F. (160&times;10) at F. 200, he has V. 130 and
60; says of V. 60, 'Very agreeable elements in connection
with the relation of the two lines.'</p>

<p><i>C</i> takes for F. (80&times;10) only one mechanical choice until
it is at F. 120. Then always mechanical, <i>i.e.</i>, nearer center;
for F. (160&times;10) makes after the position F. 40 no mechanical
choice, <i>i.e.</i>, V. is nearer center.</p>

<p>It is evident from the above tables and individual cases that
the reversals from the mechanical choice occur only when the
mechanical choice would bring both lines in the center, or both
near the edges, and the subjective testimony shows from what
point of view this appears desirable. The subjects wish 'to
take in the whole field,' they wish 'not to be disturbed by too
large a black space in the center'; and when, in order to cover
in some way the whole space, the small line is drawn in or the
large one pushed out, they have, nevertheless, a feeling of
equilibrium in spite of the reversal of mechanical balance.</p>

<p>Accepting for the present, without seeking a further psychological
explanation, the type of 'mechanical balance,' in
<span class="pagenum">[490]</span><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490"></a>which amount of space is a substitute for weight, as the one
most often observed, we have to seek some point of view from
which this entire reversal is intelligible. For even the feeling
that 'the whole field must be covered' would hardly account
for an exact interchanging of positions. If size gives 'weight,'
why does it not always do so? A simple answer would seem
to be given by the consideration that we tend to give most attention
to the center of a circumscribed space, and that any object
in that center will get proportionately more attention than on the
outskirts. The small line near the center, therefore, would
attract attention by virtue of its centrality, and thus balance the
large line, intrinsically more noticeable but farther away.
Moreover, all the other moments of &aelig;sthetic pleasure, derived
from the even filling of the space, would work in favor of this
arrangement and against the mechanical arrangement, which
would leave a large black space in the middle.</p>

<p>The hypothesis, then, that the demand for the filling of the
whole space without large gaps anywhere enters into competition
with the tendency to mechanical balance, and that this tendency
is, nevertheless, reconciled with that demand through the
power of a central position to confer importance, would seem to
fit the facts. It is, of course, clear that neither 'mechanical
balance' nor the balance of 'central' with 'intrinsic' importance
have been yet accounted for on psychological grounds;
it is sufficient at this point to have established the fact of some
kind of balance between elements of different qualities, and to
have demonstrated that this balance is at least not always to be
translated into the 'mechanical' metaphor.</p>


<h4><i>C. Experiments on Movement.</i></h4>

<p>In the preceding experiments the element of size was isolated,
and it was sought to discover, in pleasing combinations of objects
of different sizes, the presence of some kind of balance and the
meaning of different tendencies of arrangement. The relative
value of the two objects was taken as determined on the assumption,
supported by common sense, that under like conditions a
large object is given more attention than a small one. If the
unequal objects seem to balance each other, then the only other
<span class="pagenum">[491]</span><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491"></a>condition in which they differ, their distance from the center,
must be the cause of their balancing. Thus the influence of
relative position, being the only unknown quantity in this balance-equation,
is easily made out.</p>

<p>The following experiments will deal with the as yet quite
undetermined elements of suggested movement, perspective and
intrinsic interest. By combining objects expressing them, each
with another simple object of the same size, another equation
will be obtained in which there is only one unknown quantity,
the sizes of the objects being equal and the influence of relative
position being at least clearly indicated.</p>


<p>1. Movement.</p>

<p>The experiments on suggestion of movement were made by
<i>C</i>, <i>O</i> and <i>P</i>. Suggestions of movement in pictures are of two
kinds&mdash;given by lines pointing in a direction which the eye of
the spectator tends to follow, and by movement represented as
about to take place and therefore interpreted as the product of
internal energy. Thus, the tapering of a pyramid would give
the first kind of suggestion, the picture of a runner the second
kind. Translated into terms of experiment, this distinction would
give two classes dealing with (A) the direction of a straight line
as a whole, and (B) the expression of internal energy by a curve
or part of a line. In order to be able to change the direction of
a straight line at a given point, a strip of tin two inches long was
fastened by a pivot to the usual clasp which slipped up and
down on the vertical black strip. The tin strip could be moved
about the pivot by black threads fastened to its perforated ends.
A strip of cardboard glued upon it would then take its direction.
The first experiments, made with the usual 80&times;10 strip, proved
very disagreeable. The subject was much disturbed by the
blunt ends of the strip. The variable (pivoted) line was then
slightly pointed at the upper end, and in the final experiments,
in which both are oblique, both strips were pointed at each end.
In Exp. III. a line pointing at an angle from the perpendicular
was set over against a line of the same dimensions in the ordinary
position.<span class="pagenum">[492]</span><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492"></a></p>

<div class="blkquot"><p class="center">Exp. III. (<i>a</i>) F. (80&times;10) pointed up toward center at 145&deg;, V. (80&times;10).</p>

<p>The most striking point about these groups is the frequency
of positions far from the center when F. also is far out. At F.
120, a position at which the mechanical choice usually prevails
if F. is smaller, a very marked preference indeed appears for
positions of V. nearer the center&mdash;in fact, there is only one
opposing (first) choice. Now, if it is not the wide space otherwise
left which pulls the variable in,&mdash;and we see from a note
that the subjects have no feeling of a large empty space in the
center,&mdash;it must be that F. has the same effect as if it were
really smaller than V., that is, mechanically 'light.' We see,
in fact, that the moment F. has passed the point, between 80
and 100, at which both lines close together in the center would
be disagreeable, the preference is marked for inner positions of
V., and I repeat that this cannot be for space-filling reasons,
from the testimony of F. 200 (3).</p>

<p>And this 'lightness' of the line pointed in at 45&deg; is indeed
what we should have expected <i>a priori</i> since we found that
objective heaviness is balanced by a movement out from the
center on the mechanical principle. If movement out and objective
heaviness are in general alike in effect, then movement
<span class="pagenum">[493]</span><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493"></a>in and objective lightness should be alike in effect, as we have
found to be the case from the preceding experiments. The inward-pointed
line does not actually move in, it is true, but it
strongly suggests the completion of the movement. It enters
into the 'mechanical' equation&mdash;it appears to balance&mdash;as if
it had moved.</p>

<p>The point, however, in which this 'lightness' of the inward-pointed
line differs from that of the small or short line is its
space-filling quality. It suggests movement in a certain direction,
and, while giving the mechanical effect of that movement
as completed, seems also in a sense to cover that space. We
see from F. 180 (3), (4), and 200 (3), that the subject does not
shrink from large spaces between the lines, and does not, as in
Exp. I. (<i>a</i>), 4 and 5, bring the variable, which in both cases is
evidently 'heavier,' to the center. This must be from the fact
that the empty space does not in this experiment feel empty&mdash;it
is filled with energy of the suggested movement. This view
is confirmed by the dislike which the subjects show to the position
F. 40; F., being 'lighter,' but the object of attention as close
to the center, might well balance V. far out. But as if the
whole variable field would be in that case 'overfilled,' the records
show 50 per cent. of refusals to choose for this position.</p>

<p>In brief, then, a straight line suggesting movements in a
certain direction has the effect, in the general scheme of mechanical
balance, of a static position in which this movement
has been carried out, with the added suggestion of the filling
of the space over which such movement is suggested.</p>

<p>A few additional experiments were made with a point on the
upper end of V. The groups of III. (<i>a</i>) are maintained almost
exactly: F. 120 is again strikingly 'mechanical'; after F. 120
there are only two mechanical choices out of nineteen; while
for F. 40, as in Exp. III. (<i>a</i>), out of six choices, four are
either refusals or question-marked.</p>

<p>Exp. IV. Both lines took oblique directions, and, to get a
pleasing effect, were pointed at both ends. They were of the
usual size, 80&times;10 mm., but 1 mm. broader to allow for the
effect of length given by the points. F. was fixed at 45&deg;, as
in III. (<i>a</i>), on the points 40, 80, 120 and 160; V. moved also
<span class="pagenum">[494]</span><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494"></a>on fixed points, 60, 100, 140, 180, for each position of F., but
on each point was adjusted at a pleasing angle. Thus, there
were four positions of V. to each of F., each with one or two
angular positions; V. was always in the first quadrant.</p>

<p>The tendency to mechanical balance would, according to
our previous analysis, lead the variable to take a direction
which, in its suggestion of motion inward, should be more or
less strong according as it were farther from or nearer to the
center than the fixed line. Such motion inward would, of
course, be more strongly suggested by an angle less than 45&deg;
than by an angle greater than 45&deg;, and it seems that the angles
chosen are in general in harmony with this expectation. For
the positions where F. is nearer the center than V. there is a
preponderance of the angles less than 45&deg; (cf. F. 40 and F. 80,
V. 100 and 140; F. 120, V. 140, 180). When V. passes over
to a position farther from the center than F. (<i>e.g.</i>, from F. 80,
V. 60, to F. 80, V. 100 and from F. 120, V. 60, to F. 120, V.
140) the change is marked. In every case where F. is farther
from the center than V. (<i>i.e.</i>, F. 80, V. 60; F. 120, V. 60 and<span class="pagenum">[495]</span><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495"></a>
V. 100; F. 160, V. 60, V. 100 and V. 140), there are to be
noticed a lack of the very small angles and a preponderance of
the middle and larger angles. F. 160, V. 140 and 180 seem
to be the only exceptions, which are easily explainable by a
dislike of the extremely small angle near the edge; for it
appears from the remarks of the subjects that there is always a
subconsciousness of the direction suggested by the lower pointed
end of the line. For the outer positions of both lines, a large
angle would leave the center empty, and a small one would be
disagreeable for the reason just given; and so we find, indeed,
for F. 160, V. 100, 140, 160, the middle position the favorite
one.</p>

<p>The representation of action may be translated into experimental
terms by expressing it as a line which changes its direction,
thus seeming to be animated by some internal energy.

<p>It is evident that in the great majority of cases when the
curve turns out it is placed nearer the center, when it turns in,
farther from the center, than the straight line. The numerical
differences for choices of the same type for the two curves are
slight, but regular, and the general tendencies are more sharply
marked for the line of greater curvature. When Curve II. is
'out,' it is usually nearer the center than Curve I. for the corresponding
positions of the straight line; when 'in' it is always
farther from the center than Curve I. The greater curvature
of II. has clearly produced this difference, and the effect of the
curvature in general is evidently to make its side 'lighter' when
turned toward the center, and 'heavier' when turned away.
Thus, all but the exceptions already noted seem to belong to
the mechanically balanced arrangement, in which the suggestion
of force working in the direction of the curve has the same
effect as, in Exp. IV., the direction of the line. The exceptions
noted, especially numerous choices of <i>O</i>, seem governed by
some fixed law. The evidence would seem to be overwhelming
that the reversals of the mechanical balance occur only where
the lines would be crowded together in the center or would
leave an empty gap there. The remaining exceptions&mdash;the
symmetrical choices mentioned, made by <i>C</i>&mdash;are explained by
him as follows. He says there are two ways of regarding the
curve, (1) as a striving in the direction of the 'bulge,' and (2)
as the expression of a power that presses together; and that the
usual choices are the result of the first point of view, the symmetrical
<span class="pagenum">[498]</span><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498"></a>choices of the second. Naturally, a pressure bending
down the line would be conceived as working in a vertical direction,
and the line would be treated as another (80&times;10)&mdash;giving,
as is the case, symmetrical positions. Thus, we may consider
the principle of the suggestion of movement by a curve, as
giving the same effect as if the movement suggested had actually
taken place, to have been established, the positive evidence being
strong, and the exceptions accounted for. It is worth noting
that the curve-out series are always more irregular&mdash;the subject
repeating that it is always harder to choose for that position.
Probably the demands of space-filling come into sharper conflict
with the tendency to mechanical balance, which for the outward
curve would always widely separate the two lines.</p>

<p>This curve exemplifies the same principles as the preceding.
<i>O</i> takes the natural mechanical choice from (<i>a</i>) F. 40 to F. 120,
and from (<i>b</i>) F. 120 to F. 200. A mechanical choice, however,
for (<i>a</i>) F. 120 ff., and for (<i>b</i>) F. 40 to F. 120, would have
brought the lines too far apart in (<i>a</i>), and too near together in
(<i>b</i>), hence the reversal. <i>C</i> inclines always to the mechanical
choice, but recognizes the other point of view in his second
choices.<span class="pagenum">[499]</span><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499"></a></p>

<p><i>C</i> puts V. always further than F. and, even for F. 200, has

mechanical choice, and <i>O</i> reverses it only beyond (<i>a</i>) F. 120,
and up to (<i>b</i>) F. 120, to fill space well, showing his preference
for the mechanical choice by changing into it at an unusually
early point.</p></div>

<p>Comparing all the results of this whole series of experiments
on the suggestion of movement, we may conclude that movement,
whether suggested by a whole line or part of a line, produces
in terms of mechanical balance the same effect that the
balanced object would produce after the completion of the suggested
motion. This tendency to balance, it appears, lies at
the basis of our preference; it often gives way, however, before
considerations of space-filling, when the figure which on the
scheme of mechanical balance is weaker, gains interest and so
'heaviness' by being brought nearer the center.</p></div>

<h4><i>D. Experiments on Interest.</i></h4>

<p>By intrinsic interest is meant the interest which would attach
to an object quite apart from its place in the space composition.<span class="pagenum">[500]</span><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500"></a>
In a picture it would be represented by the interest in
an important person, in an unusual object, or in an especially
beautiful object, if that beauty were independent of the other
forms in the picture&mdash;as, for instance, a lovely face, or a
jeweled goblet, etc. When the question of the influence of
interest on composition came to be discussed, it was found very
difficult to abstract the form of the object from the content presented;
still more difficult to obtain an effect of interest at all
without the entrance of an element of form into the space arrangement.
Disembodied intellectual interest was the problem,
and the device finally adopted seemed to present, in as indifferent
a form as possible, a content whose low degree of
absolute interest was compensated for by constant change.
Stamps of various countries in black and white reproductions
and very small outline pictures on squares of the same size as
the stamps were taken as material. The figures were so small
in relation to the board that any influence on composition of the
lines composing them was impossible; the outline pictures, indeed,
gave to the eye which abstracted from their content an impression
scarcely stronger than the neighboring blank square.</p>

<p>The first set of experiments (VI.) had a small outline picture
on the side, and on the other a white paper square of the
same size. The necessary interest was given in the form of
novelty by changing the picture for every choice. The subjects
were <i>M</i>, <i>G</i> and <i>D</i>. The results were of the same type
for each subject and could therefore be averaged.</p>

<div class="blkquot">
<p class="center">Exp. VI. (1).</p>
<p><i>(a)</i> F. Picture, V. Blank. Eight choices for each.</p>
<p><i>M</i>, Average: V. 17 mm. farther from center.</p>
<p><i>G</i>, Average: V. 10 mm. farther from center. (Symmetrical
position beyond F. 120.)</p>
<p><i>D</i>, Average: V. 25.8 mm. farther from center.</p>

<p><i>(b)</i> F. Blank, V. Picture.</p>
<p><i>M</i>, Average: V. 33 mm. nearer center.</p>
<p><i>G</i>, Average: V. 4 mm. nearer center. (Symmetrical beyond
F. 120.)</p>
<p><i>D</i>, Average: V. 30 mm. nearer center. (But V. farther
at F. 40.)</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[501]</span><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501"></a>These results are practically unanimous. They show that
an object which possesses intrinsic interest acts like a mechanically
heavy object, being placed nearer the center than a blank.
Two marked deviations from the mechanical choice occur&mdash;although
they have not affected the average sufficiently to destroy
the general harmony of results. <i>G</i>, in both <i>(a)</i> and <i>(b)</i>,
chooses symmetrical positions from F. 120 on. His notes
['<i>(a)</i> F. 140, V. 136, picture unimportant'; '<i>(b)</i> F. 120 and
ff., loses relation as they separate'; '<i>(b)</i> F. 160, picture makes
no impression'] show clearly that for positions wide apart the
picture, already a faint outline, becomes only a white square
like the other and is put into geometrical symmetry.</p>

<div class="blkquot">
<p>Exp. VI. (2), by <i>G</i> and <i>D</i>. A stamp on one side unchanged,
took the place of the blank; on the other side the stamp was
changed for each choice.</p>

<p><i>(a)</i> F. unchanged stamp; V. changed stamp.</p>

<p><i>D</i>. Two series, (1) V. always nearer center. (2) Same,
except F. 20, V. 52; F. 80, V. 94; F. 140, V. 152; F. 160,
V. 175.</p>

<p><i>G</i>. Two series. (1) V. much farther from center up to
F. 140, then nearer. (2) V. farther throughout, except F. 160,
V. 121.</p>

<p><i>(b)</i> F. changed stamp; V. unchanged stamp.</p>

<p><i>D</i>. Two series. (1) V. farther up to F. 100, then symmetrical.
(2) V. farther up to F. 100, then symmetrical or nearer
center.</p>

<p><i>G</i>. Two series. (1) V. farther up to F. 120, then symmetrical,
and beyond F. 140, nearer center. F. 140, V. 63.
(2) V. much farther up to F. 120, then nearer center, but more
nearly symmetrical than (1). A complete series of second
choices beginning at F. 40, V. slightly nearer center than F.</p></div>

<p>Analyzing results, we find the changed stamp, which has
the interest of novelty, nearly always nearer the center than the
unchanged. This would indicate a balance of the mechanical
type, in which the interest makes an object 'heavier.' The
exceptions are in <i>(a)</i> four choices of <i>D</i>, <i>G</i> to F. 140, and in <i>(b)</i>,
<i>D</i>'s choice beyond F. 200, and <i>G</i>'s beyond F. 120. The deviations
are thus seen to be all of the same type: for positions of F.<span class="pagenum">[502]</span><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502"></a>
near the center, when a mechanical choice would have brought
V. still nearer [(<i>a</i>)], it is instead put farther away; for positions
of F. far from the center, when a mechanical choice would
have put V. still farther away [(<i>b</i>)], it is instead brought near.
The exceptions are thus fully accounted for by the demand for
space-filling.</p>


<h4><i>E. Experiments on Depth.</i></h4>

<p>The experiments on suggestion of depth in the third dimension
were as follows. It was desired to contrast two objects
differing only with respect to the degree to which they
expressed the third dimension. Those objects that do express
the third dimension are, in general, views down streets, colonnades,
corridors, gates, etc., or, in landscape, deep valleys,
vistas between trees, distant mountains, etc. It is evident that
representations of products of human handiwork would be less
unnatural when isolated for experiment, and two pairs of pictures
were accordingly prepared as follows: There was drawn
on a square of 80 mm. the picture of the mouth of a railway
tunnel, closed tightly by an apparently massive door; and another
picture of identical form and surroundings, but showing
the rails entering at a slight curve, the deep blackness within,
and the small circle of light at the farther end. The second
pair consisted of the gateway of a baronial castle, with heraldic
bearings and closed iron-wrought doors; and the same gateway
open, showing a flagged pavement and an open court with
fountain beyond. The perspective effect was heightened by
all possible means for both pictures, and care was taken to have
the contrast of black and white the same for each pair, so that
to the half-shut eye, opened and closed forms seemed to have
the same tone.</p>

<p>The subjects were directed to try to <i>feel</i> the third dimension
as vividly as possible&mdash;to project themselves down the vistas,
as it were&mdash;and then to arrange the squares in the most pleasing
manner. The experiments were made by <i>A</i>, <i>M</i>, <i>S</i>, <i>H</i> and
<i>D</i>. Not all made the same number of repetitions, but as their
notes were unusually suggestive, I have made use of all the results,
and shall quote the notes for the most part <i>verbatim</i>:<span class="pagenum">[503]</span><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503"></a></p>

<p>&sup1;Second pair (Court).</p>

<p><i>Note</i>.&mdash;(1) Quite impossible to take both together; necessary
to keep turning from one to the other to get perception of
depth together with both.</p></div>

<p>The subjects agree in remarking on the lack of interest of
the closed tunnel, and the attractive power of the open tunnel,
and notes which emphasize this accompany choices where the
open tunnel is put uniformly nearer. (Cf. <i>H</i>, F. 180, V. 50;
F. 80, V. 13; <i>G</i>, (2), (3), (4), (5); <i>A</i>, (3), and F. 140.) As
a glance at the results shows that the open tunnel is placed on
the whole nearer the center, we may conclude that these choices
represent a mechanical balance, in which the open tunnel, or
depth in the third dimension, is 'heavier.'</p>

<p>But another point of view asserts itself constantly in the results
of <i>S</i>, and scatteringly in those of the others. Analyzing
at first only the results of <i>S</i>, we find that up to F. 140, with one
exception, he places the open tunnel much farther out than the
<span class="pagenum">[506]</span><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506"></a>other; and from F. 140 on, nearer. He says, F. 120, V. 185,
'After this there is too large a black space'; that is, in bringing
the open tunnel in, he is evidently filling space. But why
does he put the open tunnel so far out? It seems that he is
governed by the desire for ease in the apperception of the two
objects. In his note for F. 80, V. 180, this point of view comes
out clearly. He thinks of the objects as being apperceived side
by side with the space about each (which apparently takes on
the character of its object), and then he seems to balance these
two fields. Cf. F. 60, V. 195: 'The closed tunnel allows the
eyes to wander, and so it needs a bigger field on each side.'
Evidently there is an implication here of the idea of balance.
Cf. also F. 120: 'The black tunnel harmonizes with the black
to the right, and seems to correspond in distance and depth,'
while the closed tunnel 'hangs together with the black on the
left.' In brief, the view of F. seems to be that the closed tunnel
is less interesting, and partly because it 'allows the eyes to
wander,' partly as compensation for the greater heaviness of the
open tunnel, it takes with it a larger space than the open tunnel.
It is on the whole better to put them apart, because it is more
difficult to apperceive them when close together, and so the
open tunnel in the earlier choices must, of course, go farther
from the center. When these points conflict with the necessity
of filling space, the open tunnel comes nearer the center. In
general, the notes which emphasize the difficulty of apperceiving
the two pictures as flat and deep together accompany choices
where the tunnel is put uniformly farther out, or symmetrically.
Cf. <i>G</i>, (1), (5); <i>A</i>, (1); <i>M</i>, F. 40, etc.</p>

<p>Thus we may continue to separate the two points of view,
that of mechanical balance and that of another kind of balance,
which we have known heretofore as 'space-filling,' made possible
by the power of the center to give 'weight,' but which seems
to be now more explicitly recognized as a balancing of 'fields.'
At this point we need repeat only, however, that the suggestion
of depth in the third dimension seems to confer 'weight,'
'heaviness,' 'balancing power' on its object.</p>

<p>Before making a general survey of the results of this chapter,
it is necessary to consider a type of choice which has been
<span class="pagenum">[507]</span><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507"></a>up to this point consistently neglected&mdash;that in which the variable
has been placed on the same side of the center as the fixed
object. On the theory of balance, either in its simple mechanical
form or in its various disguises, this choice would at first
seem to be inexplicable. And yet the subjects usually took
special pleasure in this choice, when they made it at all. These
minus choices are confined to three or four subjects and to two
or three experiments. Exp. I. (a) and (b) show the largest
number. We have:</p>

<p class="tbltitle">EXP. I. (<i>a</i>) F. (80&times;10); V. (160&times;10).</p>

<p>It will be noticed that, with two exceptions, none of the
positions chosen are nearer than 70 mm. to the center, and that
most of them are much farther away. The two lines seem to
be more pleasing when they are pretty close together on the
same side. <i>S</i>, in I. (<i>b</i>) F. 120, V.-70, notes: 'If V. is nearer
<i>O</i>, there is a tendency to imagine a figure by the connection of
the ends of the two lines, which is disagreeable. 'The only
other minus choices were in Exp. VII., by <i>S,</i>, <i>H</i>, and <i>D</i>. <i>S</i>,
F. 120, V.-35, says: 'Now they can be close together,' and
<i>H</i>, F. 140, 160 and 180, V. -1, -32, -71, notes the same. So
also <i>D</i>, F. 100, V. -12; F. 140, V. -52; F. 160, V. -75; F. 180,
V. -95. It is evident from this insistence on the closeness together
of the objects, and this desire to form no figure, that the
two are taken as one, and set off against the blackness on the
other side. It seems as if this were not taken as empty space,
but acquired a meaning of its own. The association with
pictures in which the empty space is occupied by a deep vista
or an expanse of sky is almost irresistible. The case of Exp.
VII. seems a little different. <i>S</i>, at least, separates the two fields
as usual, but for him also the black space is living, 'corresponds
<span class="pagenum">[508]</span><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508"></a>in distance and depth.' It is at least certain that there
is no subjective feeling of emptiness or of unoccupied energies
on the empty side. And it would seem that some influence
from the objects sweeps across the central field and vitalizes it.
The most natural view would seem to be that the ease of apperception
of the two objects together, and the tendency of the
eye movement to begin on the occupied side, and to sweep
across to the unoccupied, which we think of as deep, combine
to give a feeling of pleasure and of balance.</p>

<hr  />

<p>We have now reached a point from which a backward
glance can be cast upon the territory traversed. Experiment
with the isolated elements in pictorial composition has shown
that pleasing arrangements of these elements can be interpreted
by the formula of mechanical balance. This principle was obtained
by opposing two lines whose relative value (corresponding
to 'weight' in balance) was known; and it was found that their
relative positions corresponded to the relation of the arms of a
balance. Further opposition of lines, of which one was already
determined in 'weight,' showed the same variations and suggested
certain valuations of the undetermined lines on the
basis of this common term of weight. Thus, the line suggesting
movement out from the center fitted the formula if
taken as 'heavy' and <i>vice versa</i>, the line suggesting movement
in, if taken as 'light.' Similarly, objects of interest
and objects suggesting movement in the third dimension
were 'heavy' in the same interpretation. But this interpretation,
in its baldest form, fitted only a majority of the pleasing
arrangements; the minority, in which the consistent carrying
out of the lever principle would have left a large unoccupied
space in the center, exactly reversed it, bringing the 'light' element
to the center and the 'heavy' to the outer edge. Later
experiments showed that this choice implied a power in the
'lighter' objects, owing to their central position, to cover or
infuse with vitality the empty space about them, so that the principle
of balance seemed to maintain itself in one form or another.</p>

<p>All this does not go beyond the proof that all pleasing space
arrangements can be described in terms of mechanical balance.<span class="pagenum">[509]</span><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509"></a>
But what is this mechanical balance? A metaphor, no matter
how consistently carried out, explains nothing. The fact that
a small object far from the center is usually opposed by a large
object near the center tells us nothing of the real forces involved.
Physical balance can be explained by principles of mechanics,
but no one will maintain that the visual representation of a long
line weighs more than that of a short one. Moreover, the elements
in the balance seem utterly heterogeneous. The movement
suggested by an idea&mdash;the picture of a man running&mdash;has
been treated as if equivalent to the movement actually made
by the eye in following a long line; the intrinsic interest&mdash;that is,
the ideal interest&mdash;of an object insignificant in form has been
equated to the attractive power of a perspective which has, presumably,
a merely physiological effect on the visual mechanism.
What justification can be given either of this heterogeneous
collection of elements or of the more or less arbitrary and external
metaphor by which they have been interpreted?</p>

<p>I believe that the required justification of both points of view
is given in the reduction of all elements to their lowest term&mdash;as
objects for the expenditure of attention. A large object and an
interesting object are 'heavy' for the same reason, because they
call out the attention; a deep perspective, because the eye
rests in it;&mdash;why, is another question. And expenditure of
effort is expenditure of attention; thus, if an object on the outskirts
of the field of vision requires a wide sweep of the eye
to take it in, it demands the expenditure of attention, and so is
felt as 'heavy.' It may be said that involuntary attention is
given to the object of intrinsic interest, while the uninteresting
object far on the outskirts needs a voluntary effort to perceive
it, and that the two attitudes cannot be treated as identical. To
this it may be answered that an object on the outskirts of a field
of view so definitely limited calls out of itself a reflex movement
of the eye toward it, as truly spontaneous as the impulse toward
the object of intrinsic interest. But what is 'the expenditure
of attention' in physiological terms? It is nothing more than
the measure of the motor impulses directed to the object of
attention. And whether the motor impulse appears as the tendency
to fixate an object or as the tendency to follow out the suggestions
<span class="pagenum">[510]</span><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510"></a>of motion in the object, they reduce to the same physiological
basis. It may here be objected that our motor impulses
are, nevertheless, still heterogeneous, inasmuch as some are
<i>toward</i> the object of interest, and some <i>along</i> the line of movement.
But it must be said, first, that these are not felt in the
body, but transferred as values of weight to points in the picture&mdash;it
is the amount and not the direction of excitement that is
counted; and secondly, that even if it were not so, the suggested
movement along a line is felt as 'weight' at a particular
point.</p>

<p>From this point of view the justification of the metaphor of
mechanical balance is quite clear. Given two lines, the most
pleasing arrangement makes the larger near the center, and the
smaller far from it. This is balanced because the spontaneous
impulse of attention to the near, large line, equals in amount
the involuntary expenditure of attention to apprehend the small
farther one. And this expenditure of motor impulses is pleasing,
because it is the type of motor impulses most in harmony with
our own physical organism.</p>

<p>We may thus think of a space to be composed as a kind of
target, in which certain spots or territories count more or less,
both according to their distance from the center and according
to what fills them. Every element of a picture, in whatever way
it gains power to excite motor impulses, is felt as expressing
that power in the flat pattern. A noble vista is understood and
enjoyed as a vista, but it is <i>counted</i> in the motor equation, our
'balance,' as a spot of so much intrinsic value at such and such
a distance from the center. The skilful artist will fill his target
in the way to give the maximum of motor impulses with the perfection
of balance between them.</p>


<h3>IV. SYMMETRY IN PICTURES.</h3>

<h4><i>A. The Balancing Factors.</i></h4>

<p>The experimental treatment of suggestions as to the elements
in pictorial composition has furnished an hypothesis for the basis
of our pleasure in a well-composed picture, and for the particular
<span class="pagenum">[511]</span><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511"></a>function of each of the several elements. This hypothesis
may be expressed as follows: (1) The basis of &aelig;sthetic
pleasure in composition is a <i>balance of motor impulses</i> on the
part of the spectator; (2) this balance of motor impulses is
brought about by means of the elements, through the power
which they possess of drawing the attention with more or less
strength towards a certain field. But to the experimental working
out of an hypothesis must succeed a verification, in its application
to the masterpieces of civilized art. We have, then,
to ask whether there is in all great pictures a balance, <i>i.e.</i>, an
equal distribution of attention on the two sides of the central
line suggested by the frame of the picture. It might be, for
instance, that a picture of pleasing composition would show,
when analyzed, all the attractions for attention on one side;
which would go far to impugn either our hypothesis of balance
as the basis of pleasure, or our attribution of particular functions
to the elements. But as this second matter may be considered
to have been sufficiently determined by the results of the preceding
section, the first question only remains: Is there a balance
of attention in a good picture&mdash;or rather, in the particular
good pictures known to the student of art?</p>

<p>This question could only be answered by the examination
of a large number of pictures of accepted merit, and it was also
desirable that they should be studied in a form which lent itself
to the easy comparison of one picture with another. These
conditions seemed to be best fulfilled by the collection of reproductions
in black and white known as the <i>Classischer Bilderschatz</i>,
published by F. Bruckmann, at Munich, which contains
over a thousand pictures arranged in schools. Of these a
thousand were taken&mdash;substantially the first thousand issued,
after the frescoes, triptych doors, panels, etc., which are evidently
parts of a larger whole, had been laid aside. In the following
discussion the pictures will be designated, when they are
not further described, by the numbers which they bear in this
collection.</p>

<p>The equations in the following discussion are based on a
system of exact measurement, corresponding to that followed
in the experimental section. This numerical treatment is pre-supposed
<span class="pagenum">[512]</span><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512"></a>in all the general attributions of balance in the analysis
of single pictures. The method of measurement was
given by the conditions of viewing pictures, which are framed
and thus isolated from surrounding influences, and referred, as
compositions, to the middle line suggested by this emphasized
frame. An adjustable frame of millimeter paper, divided in
half vertically by a white silk thread, was fitted over the picture
to be measured, and measurements were made to left and to
right of this thread-line and, as required, vertically, by reference
to the millimeter frame divisions.</p>

<p>The main question, of course, to be answered by a statistical
examination of these thousand pictures refers to the existence
of balance, but many other problems of symmetry are also seen
to be closely involved; the relative frequency of the elements in
pictures of different types, and the result of their employment
in producing certain emotional effects, also the general types of
space arrangement as a whole, the feeling-tone belonging to
them, and the relation between content and shape. The first
question will not be treated in this paper in the statistical fulness
which was necessary to establish my conclusions in the investigation
itself, inasmuch as the tables were very extensive.
But examples of the tables, together with the full results, will
be given, and a sufficient amount of detailed discussion to
show my methods. The two other subjects, the use of the
elements and the types of composition, will be briefly treated.
I expect in other publications to go more closely into statistical
detail on these matters than is possible in a merely experimental
thesis.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the proposed statistical analysis a natural
objection must first be forestalled: it will be said, and
truly, that color also has its effect in bringing about balance,
and that a set of black and white reproductions, therefore, ignores
an important element. To this it may be answered, first,
that as a matter of fact the color scheme is, as it were, superimposed
upon the space-shape, and with a balance of its own,
all the elements being interdependent; and secondly, that the
black and white does render the intensity contrasts of the colors
very well, giving as light and dark, and thus as interesting<span class="pagenum">[513]</span><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513"></a>
(= attractive) and the reverse, those factors in the scheme which
are most closely related to the complex of motor impulses.
After having compared, in European galleries, the originals of
very many of these reproductions with the equation of balance
worked out from the black and white, the writer has seldom
found an essential correction needed.</p>

<p>The pictures were first classified by subjects. This may
seem less logical than a division by types of arrangement. But
it really, for a majority, amounted to the same thing, as the
historical masterpieces of art mostly follow conventional arrangements;
thus the altarpieces, portraits, genre pictures, etc., were
mostly after two or three models, and this classification was of
great convenience from every other point of view. The preliminary
classification was as follows: (1) Religious, Allegorical
and Mythical Pictures; (2) Portraits; (3) Genre; (4) Landscape.
The historical pictures were so extremely few that they
were included in the religious, as were also all the allegorical
pictures containing Biblical persons. Some pictures, of which
Watteau's are representative, which hovered between genre and
landscape, were finally classified according as they seemed to
owe their interest to the figures or to the scenery. A preliminary
classification of space arrangements, still with reference
to content, showed three large general types: (1) A single subject
or group in the middle; (2) the same somewhat on one
side, with subordinate elements occupying the rest of the space;
(3) two objects or groups each occupying a well-defined center.
These were designated as Single Center, Single and Subordinate
Center, and Double Center pictures, or S.C., S. &amp; S., and D.C.
They are in proportions of S.C. 79 per cent., S. &amp; S. 5 percent.,
D.C. 16 per cent. The D.C. type is evidently already explicitly
balanced as regards shape and intrinsic interest, and is hence
of comparative unimportance to our problem. The S.C. will
show a balance, if at all, in more or less accessory factors; S.
&amp; S., broadly, between interest and other factors. As logically
more important, this last group will be treated more fully. The
full classification of the thousand pictures by subjects is as

<h4>Altarpieces.</h4>

<p>The pictures of the first group, consisting of the <i>Madonna</i>
and <i>Infant Christ</i> surrounded by worshippers, and briefly
designated as Altarpieces, are good for detailed study because
they present a simple type, and it will be easy to show whether
the variations from symmetry are in the direction of balance or
not. A few examples will make this clear. The Madonna in
the S.C. pictures is invariably seated holding the Christ.</p>

<p>In the following descriptions M. will denote Madonna, C.
Child, Cn. central line. The elements, Size or Mass, Direction
of Motion or Attention, Direction of Line, Vista, and Interest,
will be set down as Ms., D., L., V., and I. A couple of examples
will show the method of describing and of drawing a conclusion
as to balance.</p>

<p>1. 969. Lorenzo Lotto, <i>Madonna with St. Bernard and
St. Onofrius.</i> C. is on one side turning to the same; M. leans
far to the other; hence interest in C., and direction of C.'s
attention are over against Mass of M. and direction of M.'s
attention; <i>i.e.</i>, I. + D. = Ms. + D., and so far, balance. The
surrounding saints are insignificant, and we may make the
equation I. = Ms.</p>

<p>2. 368. Raffaelino di Francesco, <i>Madonna Enthroned.</i>
The C. is on Right facing front, M. turns away Left, hence
interest in C. is over against direction of M.'s attention. Moreover,
all the saints but one turn Left, and of two small vistas
<span class="pagenum">[515]</span><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515"></a>behind the throne, the one on the Left is deeper. The superior
interest we feel in C. is thus balanced by the tendency of attention
to the opposite side, and we have I. = D. + V.</p>

<p>It is clear that the broad characteristics of the composition
can be symmetrically expressed, so that a classification of the
70 S.C. altarpieces can be made on a basis of these constant
elements, in the order of decreasing balance. Thus: Class
1, below, in which the C. is one side of the central line,
turned away from the center, the M. turned to the other,
balances in these broad lines, or I. + D. = D.; while in (9),
I. + D. + D. = (x), the constant elements work all on one side.</p>

<p class="tbltitle">CLASSIFICATION OF ALTARPIECES.</p>

<div class="center"><table border="0" summary="">

<tr><td>4</td><td>&quot;</td><td>&quot;</td><td>&quot;</td><td>other,</td><td>M.</td><td>front.</td><td>9</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>&quot;</td><td>&quot;</td><td>&quot;</td><td>facing</td><td>M.</td><td></td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>&quot;</td><td>&quot;</td><td>&quot;</td><td>front,</td><td>M.</td><td>front.</td><td>7</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>&quot;</td><td>in middle,</td><td>turned</td><td>front.</td><td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td><td>0</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Thus the constant elements, understanding always that C.
has more interest than M., are as follows: For (1) I. + D. = D.;
(2) I. = D. + D.; (3) I. = D.; (4) I. = D.; (5) I. + D. = D.;
etc. These are in order of complete balance, but it will be seen
that from (7) on, while the factors are constant, the framework
is not balanced; <i>e.g.</i> in (9) both I. and D. work on the same
side. For these groups, therefore, the variations, if there is
balance, will be more striking. Eliminating the balancing elements
in the framework, the tables for the ten groups are:</p>

<p>The most used element is I., in 100 per cent. of cases; the
least used, V., 13 per cent. D., in 91 per cent. of cases; Ms.,
26 per cent.; L., 19 per cent. 175, 433, unbalanced.</p>

<p>As seen in the table, a balance of elements is kept, except
in four cases which will be hereafter considered. In all cases
the balance is between the interest in C., sometimes plus D.,
(in the attention of the figures to C.), on the one side, and other
elements on the other. Very seldom are other salient points
found on the C. side. When the C. side is especially 'heavy,'
the number of opposing elements increases, and especially takes
the form of V. and L. [cf. (7), (8), (9)], which were observed
in the experimental chapter to be powerful in attracting attention.
For the fairly well-balancing framework&mdash;(i), (2), (3)
and (4)&mdash;Ms., I., and D. are much more often the opposing
elements.</p>

<p>The pictures listed as unbalanced are, with one exception,
among the oldest examples given; conceived in the most slavish
geometrical symmetry in which, indeed, the geometrical outline
almost hides the fact that the slight variations are all toward a
lack of balance.</p>

<p>There is but one S. &amp; S. case (1054), Titian, <i>The Madonna
of the House of Pesaro</i>. In this, M. and C. are on a
high throne on the Right, other figures lower down on the<span class="pagenum">[517]</span><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517"></a>
Left bearing a flag that leans back to the Left. All the lines
of the figures and of the massive architecture and the general
direction of attention bear down so strongly to Left that the
importance of the Right figures is balanced. We should have,
then, I. = I. + L. + D. The D.C. cases, seven in number,
are remarkably alike. Six have a vista separating the two
groups, in five remarkably deep and beautiful, as if to fix the
oscillating attention there. In all, M. and C., either in position
or by the direction of their lines, are nearer the Cn. than the
opposing figures, which are naturally less interesting, thus giving
an instance of the mechanical balance. Their general
equation, then, would be I. = M. or M. + L. Having shown
that the small variations from the general symmetrical type of
altar-pieces are invariably, except in primitive examples, in the
direction of substitutional symmetry, or balance, we may next
study the Madonna pictures, using the same classifications for
purposes of comparison.</p>

<p class="tblexp">Most used element, I., 100 per cent.; least used, Ms., 21
per cent. D., 96 per cent.; L., 64 per cent.; V., 27 per cent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[518]</span><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518"></a>The first thing to be noted, on comparing this table with
the preceding, is the remarkable frequency of the use of the
vista and the line. Among the altarpieces, the direction of
attention was the element most often opposed to the interesting
object; and next to that, another object of interest.
These two elements, however, here sink into comparative insignificance.
In general, balance is brought about through the
disposition of form rather than of interests. This appears in
comparing the numbers; against the use of L. in 19 per cent.
of the cases among the altarpieces, we have 64 per cent. among
the Madonna pictures; V. is used in the former cases 13 per
cent. of the times, in the latter 27 per cent. The reason for
this would appear to be that the lack of accessories in the
person of saints, worshippers, etc., and the consequent increase
in the size of M. and C. in the picture heightens the
effect of any given outline, and so makes the variations from
symmetry greater. This being the case, the compensations
would be stronger&mdash;and as we have learned that V. and L.
are of this character, we see why they are needed. None of
the M. and C., S.C. pictures fails to give a complete balance of
elements according to hypothesis. There are no well-defined
cases of S. &amp; S. or D.C.</p>


<h4>Portraits.</h4>

<p>A study of the Madonna pictures of all types, then, results
in an overwhelming confirmation of the hypothesis of substitutional
symmetry. It may be objected that the generally symmetrical
framework of these pictures suggests a complete balance,
and the next step in our analysis would, therefore, be a
type of picture which is less bound by tradition to the same
form. The portrait would seem to combine this desideratum
with generally large and simple outlines, so that the whole surface
can be statistically reported with comparative ease. A
detailed analysis of a couple of portraits may justify the classification
adopted.<span class="pagenum">[519]</span><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519"></a></p>

<p>900. Anton Raphael Mengs, <i>Self-Portrait</i>. The head of
the painter is exactly in Cn., but is turned sharply to Right,
while his shoulders turn Left. His arm and hand are stretched
out down to Right, while his other hand, holding pencil, rests
on his portfolio to Left. Hence, the D. of attention plus that of
L. on Right, balances I. in implements, plus D. of body on
Left, or D. + L. = D. + I.</p>

<p>438. B. van der Helst, <i>Portrait of Paul Potter</i>. The head
of the subject is entirely to Left of Cn., his easel on Right.
His body is turned sharply to Right, and both hands, one holding
palette and brushes, are stretched down to Right. His
full face and frontward glance are on Left. Hence, Ms. + I. in
person balances I. in implements + D. of L., or Ms. + I. = I.
+ L.</p>

<p>It is seen that the larger elements in these pictures are the
directions of the head and body, and the position of the head,
with reference to Cn. The following classification is based on
this framework.</p>

<p class="indent">II. (Ms. + I. = D.) Most used element (not in equation), I., 52 per cent. Least used, V., 26 per cent. L., 43 per cent. In 21 per cent., D. of glance opposed to D.</p>
<p class="indent">III. (Ms. + I. + D. = D.) Three cases. Two cases V. on empty side.</p>
<p class="indent">IV. (Ms. + I. = .) Two cases. One case V. on empty side.</p>
<p class="indent">V. (Ms. + I. + D. = .) Most used element, L., 60 per cent.; least used, V., 10 per cent.; 33-1/3 per cent., D. of glance to empty side.</p>

<p>The portrait class is an especially interesting object for study,
inasmuch as while its general type is very simple and constant,
for this very reason the slightest variations are sharply felt, and
have their very strongest characteristic effect. We shall, therefore,
find that the five principal factors in composition express
themselves very clearly. The general type of the portrait composition
is, of course, the triangle with the head at the apex,
and this point is also generally in the central line&mdash;in 73 per
cent. of the whole number of cases, as is seen from the table.
All cases but one are longer than they are wide, most are half-length
or more. Nevertheless, great richness of effect is
brought about by emphasizing variations. For instance, the
body and head are, in the great majority of cases, turned in the
same way, giving the strongest possible emphasis to the direction
of attention&mdash;especially powerful, of course, where all the
interest is in the personality. But it is to be observed that the
very strongest suggestion of direction is given by the direction
of the glance; and in no case, when most of the other elements
<span class="pagenum">[521]</span><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521"></a>are directed in one way, does the glance fail to come backward.
(Cf. A. II., V., and B. I., II., V.)</p>

<p>A. It is of especial value for our conclusions that that
division in which the constant elements are least balanced (V.)
is far the most numerous. Comparison of this with III. shows
that the principal element, direction of movement of head or
body, is balanced by the larger mass of the body or accessories.
Very significant, also, is the great increase in the use of V.
in this most irregular class (15 per cent. as against 1 per cent.
in III.). Three cases (214, 1087, 154, all A.V.,) fail to show
substitutional symmetry.</p>

<p>B. With the head on one side of Cn., of course the greatest
interest is removed to one side, and the element of direction
is brought in to balance. Again, with this decrease in symmetry,
we see the significant increase in the use of the especially
effective elements, V. and L. (Cf. B. I., II., III., IV.,
and especially V.) In fact, the use of the small deep vista is
almost confined to the class with heads not in the middle. The
direction of the glance also plays an important part. It is to be
noted that in B. I. and II., I. appears as the most frequently
used element, exclusive of the general equation, which is, of
course, between the mass of the body and interest of the face,
on one side, and the direction of suggested movement on the
other. This means that very often the direction of movement
alone is not sufficient to balance the powerful Ms. + I. of the
other side, and that the eye has to be attracted by a definite
object of interest. This is usually the hand, with or without an
implement&mdash;like the palette, etc., of our first examples&mdash;or a
jewel, vase, or bit of embroidery. This is very characteristic
of the portraits of Rembrandt and Van Dyck.</p>

<p>In general, it may be said that (1) portraits with the head in
the center of the frame show a balance between the direction
of suggested movement on one side, and mass or direction of
attention, or both together, on the other; while (2) portraits
with the head not in the center show a balance between mass
and interest on one side, and direction of attention, or of line,
or vista, or combinations of these, on the other. The hypothesis
of substitutional symmetry is thus completely confirmed.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="pagenum">[522]</span><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522"></a>Genre.</p>

<p>Still more unsymmetrical in their framework than portraits,
in fact the most unfettered type of all, are the genre pictures.
Being so irregular, they admit of no complete classification
based on constant elements in the framework, such as was
possible for the types already dealt with. A grouping, based
on types of composition, is indeed possible, as of triangles,
diagonals, etc., but as this begs the question of the relative
importance of line and direction of attention, and assumes that
the shape is all-important, it will not be made use of here. The
broad divisions and the relative use of the elements are given
as follows:</p>

<p>S.C. 63. Most frequent form (I. = or I. + D. =).
Most used element, I., 89 per cent.; least used, L., 44 per
cent.; D., 57 per cent.; Ms., 57 per cent.; V., 46 per cent.</p>

<p>D.C. 19. Most frequent form (I. + D. = I. + D.) Most
used element, I. (all cases); least used, L., 31 per cent.; V.,
47 per cent.; Ms., 63 per cent.; D., 42 per cent.</p>

<p>S.&amp;S. 11. Most frequent form (I. or I. + Ms. = V. or V.
+). Most used element, I., 100 per cent.; least used, L.,
20 per cent.; V., 82 per cent.; Ms., 72 per cent.; D., 27 per
cent.</p>

<p>As these are pictures with a human interest, and, therefore
full of action and particular points of interest, it was to be expected
that I. would be in all forms the element most frequently
appearing. In compositions showing great variations from
geometrical symmetry, it was also to be expected that V. and
L., elements which have been little used up to this point, should
suddenly appear in very high percentages; for, as being the
most strikingly 'heavy' of the elements, they serve to compensate
for other variations combined. In general, however, the
balance is between the interesting side, which is also often the
most occupied (I. + Ms.), and the direction of suggestion to the
other side.</p>

<p>For the first time in this investigation the S. &amp; S. and D.C.
types appear in appreciable numbers. It is of some significance
that the most irregular type of all, S. &amp; S., in which the
weight of interest and of mass is overwhelmingly on one side,
<span class="pagenum">[523]</span><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523"></a>should be invariably balanced by the third dimension (V.). As
these somewhat infrequent cases are especially enlightening for
the theory of substitutional symmetry, it is worth while to analyze
one in detail.</p>

<p>286. Pieter de Hooch, <i>The Card-players</i>, in Buckingham
Palace, portrays a group completely on the Right of Cn., all
facing in to the table between them. Directly behind them is a
high light window, screened, and high on the wall to the extreme
Right are a picture and hanging cloaks. All goes to emphasize
the height, mass and interest of the Right side. On the
Left, which is otherwise empty, is a door half the height of the
window, giving on a brightly lighted courtyard, from which
is entering a woman, also in light clothing. The light streams
in diagonally across the floor. Thus, with all the 'weight' on
the Right, the effect of this deep vista on the Left and of its
brightness is to give a complete balance, while the suggestion
of line from doorway and light makes, together with the central
figure, a roughly outlined V, which serves to bind together all
the elements. This matter of binding together of elements is
reserved for further discussion&mdash;the purpose of this detailed
description is only to show the extraordinary power of a single
element, vista, to balance a whole composition of others, and
its significance in the tables as an increasing accompaniment of
increasing variations from symmetry.</p>

<p>The D.C. cases, inasmuch as they always present a balance
of interest at least, are less valuable for our theory;
among the variations the larger side, Ms., is often balanced by
a vista, or, combining with the usual equation for genre pictures,
Ms. + I. + D. = V. + I. + D. There is only one picture which
cannot be schematized (263).</p>


<p class="center">Landscape.</p>

<p>The landscape is another type of unfettered composition.
As it represents no action or single object or group of objects,
its parts are naturally more or less unconnected. It should,
therefore, be said that no picture was taken as D.C. unless
there was a distinct separation of the two sides. The typical
examples are analyzed in detail.<span class="pagenum">[524]</span><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524"></a></p>

<p>S.C. 912. J. van Ruysdael, <i>Forest Landscape</i>, in the
London National Gallery. In the Cn. is a stagnant pool,
backed on the Right by thick woods. A dead tree, white, very
prominent in the Right foreground, another at its foot sloping
down to Cn. On the Left a bank sloping down to Cn., a tree
at its foot; behind both, and seen also between the two central
trees, bright sky and clouds. Thus, there is on the Right,
Mass and Direction to Cn.; on the Left, Vista and Direction to
Cn.; Ms. + D. = V. + D.</p>

<p>D.C. 642. Hobbema, <i>The Watermill</i>, in Buckingham
Palace. On the Right, a bank sloping upward, a large cluster
of trees, a path leading down to Right lower corner. On the
Left, somewhat lower, the mill, and water in front of it, flowing
down to Left; clearest sky between mill and trees. Thus
Mass and Direction out are placed over against Interest (in
mill) and Direction out, plus possibly a hint of Vista, or Ms. +
D. = I. + D + V.</p>

<p>S.C. 65. Most frequent form, Ms. + I. = V. + L. Most
used element, V., 98 per cent.; least used, D., 22 per cent.

<p>S. &amp; S. One case. Ms. + I. + V. = V.</p>

<p>D.C. 22. Most frequent form, Ms. + I. or Ms. = V. or
V. + (almost invariable). Most used element, V., 100 per
cent.; least used, D., 0 per cent. Ms. 82 per cent.; I. 73
per cent.; L. 23 per cent.</p>

<p>It was, of course, to be expected that in pictures without
action there should be little suggestion of attention or of direction
of movement. What is less evident is the reason for the
high percentage of I. Of course, figures do appear in many examples,
and in most pictures some inanimate object is emphasized&mdash;as,
for instance, the mill in our second example. But
the most remarkable point of difference in these tables from the
preceding is the presence of V. in practically every example.
It is, of course, natural that somewhere in almost every picture
there should be a break to show the horizon line, for the sake
of variety, if for nothing else&mdash;but what is significant is the
part played by this break in the balancing of the picture. In
about two thirds of the examples the vista is enclosed by lines,
<span class="pagenum">[525]</span><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525"></a>or masses, and when near the center, as being at the same time
the 'heaviest' part of the picture, serves as a fulcrum or center
to bind the parts&mdash;always harder to bring together than in the
other types of pictures&mdash;into a close unity. The most frequent
form of this arrangement, as seen by the table, is a diagonal,
which just saves itself by turning up at its far end. Thus the
mass, and hence usually the special interest of the picture, is on
the one side, on the other the vista and the sloping line of the
diagonal. In very few cases is the vista behind an attractive or
noticeable part of the picture, the fact showing that it acts in
opposition to the latter, leading the eye away from it, and thus
serving at once the variety and richness of the picture, and its
unity. A pure diagonal would have line and vista both working
at the extreme outer edge of the picture, and thus too strongly&mdash;unless,
indeed, balanced by very striking elements near the
other edge.</p>

<p>This function of the vista as a unifying element is of interest
in connection with the theory of Hildebrand,<a name="FNanchor_16_142" id="FNanchor_16_142"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_16_142'>16</a> that the landscape
should have a narrow foreground and wide background, since
that is most in conformity with our experience. He adduces
Titian's <i>Sacred and Profane Love</i> as an example. But of the
general principle it may be said that not the reproduction of
nature, but the production of a unified complex of motor impulses,
is the aim of composition, and that this aim is best reached
by focusing the eye by a narrow background&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, vista.
No matter how much it wanders, it returns to that central spot
and is held there, keeping hold on all the other elements. Of
Hildebrand's example it may be said that the pyramidal composition
with the dark and tall tree in the center effectually accomplishes
the binding together of the two figures, so that a vista is
not needed. A wide background without that tree would leave
them rather disjointed.</p>

<p>Another interesting observation concerns the use of water in
landscapes. In nearly all appears an expanse of water, and in
four fifths of the cases it is either on the same side as the vista,
or in the same line with it. This is no doubt partly due to the
<span class="pagenum">[526]</span><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526"></a>light-effects which can be got on the water, but it also greatly
reinforces the peculiar effect of the vista. That effect, as has
been repeatedly said, is to concentrate, to hold, to fixate vision.
The same thing is true of the horizontal line, as was shown by
some preliminary experiments not here reported. The contrast
to the ordinary trend of lines&mdash;particularly in a landscape&mdash;together
with the strong suggestion of quiet and repose, serve
to give the same concentrating effect to the horizontal lines as
to the vista.</p>

<p>In general, it may be said that balance in landscape is
effected between Mass and Interest on one side and Vista and
Line on the other; and that unity is given especially by the
use of Vista and the horizontal lines of water.</p>

<p>A survey of the subject-types remaining on the list of page
514 shows that they may quite well be grouped together with
those already examined; that is, the Holy Families, Adorations,
Crucifixions, and Annunciations are very symmetrical in type,
and present the same characteristics as the Altarpieces. The
Miscellaneous (mostly religious) pictures, the Descents, and the
Allegorical are, for the most part, freely composed, irregular,
full of action, and resemble the genre pictures. The Single
Figure pictures, Religious, Allegorical and Genre, and the Portrait
Groups, resemble the portraits. Therefore, it may be considered
that the existence of a perfect substitutional symmetry
has been established, inasmuch as it has been shown to be almost
invariably present in the types examined.</p>

<p>The experimental treatment of the isolated elements determined
the particular function of each in distributing attention in
the field of view. The object of large size claims attention, but
does not rivet it nor draw it out powerfully; the intrinsically
interesting object does excite it, but limits it to a comparatively
small field; the suggestion of movement or of attention on the
part of pictured objects carries the attention through the field of
its operation; the vista rivets the attention without powerfully
exciting it, and the line extending in a certain direction carries
the attention in the same way as does the suggestion of movement.
But the preceding statistical analysis has shown that
while all are possibly operative in a given picture, some are
<span class="pagenum">[527]</span><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527"></a>given much more importance than others, and that in pictures
of different types different elements predominate.</p>

<p>The following table gives the distribution of the elements in
the single-center pictures already examined. The numbers
represent the per cent. of the whole number of balanced pictures
in which the given element appears once or more.</p>

<p>It is seen that in those classes with a general symmetrical
framework, the altar and Madonna pictures, the elements of
interest and direction of attention are overwhelmingly predominant&mdash;which
is the more to be expected as they appear, of
course, as variations in a symmetry which has already, so to
speak, disposed of mass and line. They give what action there
is, and when they are very strongly operative, we see by page
516, (8) and (9) and note, that they are opposed by salient lines
and deep vistas, which act more strongly on the attention than
mass; compare further Mad., V. 27 per cent., L. 64 per cent.,
as against Alt., V. 13 per cent., L. 19 per cent., as confirming
the view that they are used in the more irregular and active
pictures. But I. keeps its predominance throughout the types,
except in the portraits, where, indeed, we should not expect it
to be so powerful, since the principal object of interest must
always be the portrait head, and that is in most cases in the
Cn., and therefore not counted. Yet I. has a respectable representation
even in the portrait table, showing that such objects
as jewels, embroideries, beautiful hands, etc., count largely
too in composition. Its greatest is in the genre table, where,
of course, human interests constitute the subject matter.</p>

<p>It is among the portraits that the direction of suggestion is
most operative. Since these pictures represent no action, it
must be given by those elements which move and distribute the
attention; in accordance with which we see that line also is unusually
influential. As remarked above, the altarpieces and
Madonna pictures, also largely without action, depend largely
<span class="pagenum">[528]</span><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528"></a>for it on D., in the form of direction of attention (D. 91 per
cent.).</p>

<p>The vista, as said above, rivets and confines the attention.
We can, therefore, understand how it is that in the genre table
it suddenly appears very numerous. The active character of
these pictures naturally requires to be modified, and the vista
introduces a powerful balancing element, which is yet quiet;
or, it might be said, inasmuch as energy is certainly expended
in plunging down the third dimension, the vista introduces an
element of action of counterbalancing character. In the landscape
it introduces the principal element of variety. It is always
to be found in those parts of the picture which are opposed
to other powerful elements, and the 'heavier' the other side,
the deeper the vista. This is especially to be noted in all pictures
of the S. &amp; S. type, where the one side is very 'heavy'
and the deep vista practically invariable on the other. Also in
D.C. pictures it serves as a kind of fulcrum, or unifying element,
inasmuch as it rivets the attention between the two detached
sides. (Cf. D.C. among Alt. and Mad.)</p>

<p>The direction of suggestion by means of the indication of a
line (L.), quite naturally is more frequent in the Madonna-picture
and Portrait classes. Both these types are of large simple
outline, so that L. would be expected to tell, but more or less
irregular, so that it would not appear on both sides, thus neutralizing
its action, as often in the symmetrical altarpieces. This
neutralizing explains why it has a comparatively small per cent.
in the landscape table, it having appeared in minor form all over
the field, but less often in large salient outline. It is worth noticing
that for the D.C. of both genre and landscape, the per cent.
drops appreciably. As it is, in a decided majority of cases,
combined with V.&mdash;the shape being more or less a diagonal
slope&mdash;it is clear that it acts as a kind of bond between the
two sides, carrying the attention without a break from one to
the other.</p>

<p>The element of mass requires less comment. It appears in
greatest number in those pictures which have little action, portraits
and landscapes, and which are yet not symmetrical&mdash;in
which last case mass is, of course, already balanced. In fact,
<span class="pagenum">[529]</span><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529"></a>it must of necessity exert a certain influence in every unsymmetrical
picture, and so its percentage, even for genre pictures,
is large.</p>

<p>Thus we may regard the elements as both attracting attention
to a certain spot and dispersing it over a field. Those
types which are of a static character abound in elements which
disperse the attention; those which are of a dynamic character,
in those which make it stable. The ideal composition seems to
combine the dynamic and static elements&mdash;to animate, in short,
the whole field of view, but in a generally bilateral fashion.
The elements, in substitutional symmetry, are then simply
means of introducing variety and action. As a dance in which
there are complicated steps gives the actor and beholder a
varied and thus vivified 'balance,' and is thus more beautiful
than the simple walk, so a picture composed in substitutional
symmetry is more rich in its suggestions of motor impulse, and
thus more beautiful, than an example of geometrical symmetry.</p>

<h4><i>B. Principles of Composition.</i></h4>

<p>The particular function of the elements which are substituted
for geometrical symmetry has been made clear; their presence
lends variety and richness to the balance of motor impulses.
But the natural motor response to stimulation has another characteristic
which belongs to us as individuals. The motor response
must be balanced, but also unified. In a picture, therefore,
there must be a large outline in which all the elements are
held together, corresponding to this requirement of unity. Now
this way of holding together, this manner of combination, may
vary; and I hope to show that it not only varies with the subject
and purpose of the picture, but bears a very close relation
thereto&mdash;that, in short, it is what determines the whole character
of the picture. Just what this relation is will appear in the
study of our material.</p>

<p>Examples of these types of composition may best be found
by analyzing a few very well-known pictures. We may begin
with the class first studied, the Altarpiece, choosing a picture
by Botticelli, in the Florence Academy (746). Under
an arch is draped a canopy held up by angels; under this,
<span class="pagenum">[530]</span><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530"></a>again, sits the M. with the C. on her lap, on a throne, at the
foot of which, on each side, stand three saints. The outline of
the whole is markedly pyramidal&mdash;in fact, there are, broadly
speaking, three pyramids; of the arch, the canopy, and the
grouping. A second, much less symmetrical example of this
type, is given by another Botticelli in the Academy&mdash;<i>Spring</i>
(140). Here the central female figure, topped by the floating
Cupid, is slightly raised above the others, which, however, bend
slightly inward, so that a triangle, or pyramid with very obtuse
angle at the apex, is suggested; and the whole, which at first
glance seems a little scattered, is at once felt, when this is
grasped, as closely bound together.</p>

<p>Closely allied to this is the type of the <i>Madonna of Burgomaster
Meyer</i>, Holbein (725), in the Grand-Ducal Castle,
Darmstadt. It is true that the same pyramid is given by the
head of the M. against the shell-like background, and her
spreading cloak which envelops the kneeling donors. But still
more salient is the diamond form given by the descending rows
of these worshipping figures, especially against the dark background
of the M.'s dress. A second example, without the
pyramid backing, is found in Rubens' <i>Rape of the Daughters
of Leucippus</i> (88), in the Alte Pinakothek at Munich. Here
the diamond shape formed by the horses and struggling figures
is most remarkable&mdash;an effect of lightness which will be discussed
later in interpreting the types.</p>

<p>The famous <i>Bull</i> of Paul Potter (149), in the Royal Museum
at the Hague, furnishes a third type, the diagonal. High on
one side are grouped the herdsman, leaning on a tree which
fills up the sky on that side, and his three sheep and cow. The
head of the bull is turned toward this side, and his back and
hind leg slope down to the other side, as the ground slopes
away to a low distant meadow. The picture is thus divided by
an irregular diagonal. Somewhat more regular is the diagonal
of the <i>Evening Landscape</i>, by Cuyp (348), in the Buckingham
Palace, London. High trees and cliffs, horsemen and others,
occupy one side, and the mountains in the background, the
ground and the clouds, all slope gradually down to the other
side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[531]</span><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531"></a>It is a natural transition from this type to the V-shape of the
landscapes by Aart van der Neer, <i>Dutch Villages</i>, 245 and
420, in the London National Gallery and in the Rudolphinum
at Prague, respectively. Here are trees and houses on each
side, gradually sloping to the center to show an open sky and
deep vista. Other examples, of course, show the opening not
exactly in the center.</p>

<p>In the <i>Concert</i> by Giorgione (758), in the Pitti Gallery,
Florence, is seen the less frequent type of the square. The
three figures turned toward each other with heads on the same
level make almost a square space-shape, although it might be
said that the central player gives a pyramidal foundation. This
last may also be said of Verrocchio's <i>Tobias and the Archangels</i>
in the Florence Academy, for the square, or rather rectangle,
is again lengthened by the pyramidal shape of the two central
figures. The unrelieved square, it may here be interpolated, is
not often found except in somewhat primitive examples. Still
less often observed is the oval type of <i>Samson's Wedding feast</i>,
Rembrandt (295), in the Royal Gallery, Dresden. Here one
might, by pressing the interpretation, see an obtuse-angled
double-pyramid with the figure of Delilah for an apex, but a few
very irregular pictures seem to fall best under the given classification.</p>

<p>Last of all it must be remarked that the great majority of
pictures show a combination of two or even three types; but
these are usually subordinated to one dominant type. Such,
for instance, is the case with many portraits, which are markedly
pyramidal, with the double-pyramid suggested by the position
of the arms, and the inverted pyramid, or V, in the landscape
background. The diagonal sometimes just passes over into the
V, or into the pyramid; or the square is combined with both.</p>

<p>It is, of course, not necessary at this point to show how it is
that such an apparently unsymmetrical shape as the diagonal,
alone or in combination with other forms, nevertheless produces
an effect of balance. In all these cases of the diagonal type
the mass or interest of the one side, or the direction of subordinate
lines backward to it, balances the impulse of the line
descending to the other side. The presence of balance or substitutional
<span class="pagenum">[532]</span><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532"></a>symmetry is taken for granted in this treatment, having
been previously established, and only the modifications of
this symmetry are under consideration.</p>

<p>Now, in order to deal properly with the question of the relation
of the type of composition to the subject of the picture, complete
statistical information will be necessary. A table of the
pictures, classified by subjects and distributed under the heads
of the six major types, is accordingly subjoined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[533]</span><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533"></a>What types are characteristic of the different kinds of pictures?
In order to answer this question we must ask first,
What are the different kinds of pictures? One answer, at least,
is at once suggested to the student on a comparison of the pictures
with their groupings according to subjects. All those
which represent the Madonna enthroned, with all variations,
with or without saints, shepherds or Holy Family, are very
quiet in their action; that is, it is not really an action at all
which they represent, but an attitude&mdash;the attitude of contemplation.
This is no less true of the pictures I have called
'Adorations,' in which, indeed, the contemplative attitude is
still more marked. On the other hand, such pictures as the
'Descents,' the 'Annunciations,' and very many of the 'miscellaneous
religious,' allegorical and genre pictures, portray
a definite action or event. Taking together, for instance, in
two groups of five each, the first ten classes in the table, we
find that they fall to the six types in the following proportion:</p>

<div class="center"><table border="0" summary="" width="70%">
<colgroup span="7"><col align="left" /><col align="right" span="6" /></colgroup>
<tr><th></th><th>P.</th><th>D.P.</th><th>Dg.</th><th>V.</th><th>Sq.</th><th>Ov.</th></tr>
<tr><td>I.</td><td>66</td><td>13</td><td>05</td><td>13</td><td>03</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>II.</td><td>43</td><td>07</td><td>14</td><td>20</td><td>12</td><td>04</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Inasmuch as II. contains also many 'contemplative' pictures,
while I. contains no 'active' ones, the contrast between
the proportions of the groups would really be sharper than the
figures indicate. But as it is, we see that the pyramid type is
characteristic of the 'contemplative' pictures in a much higher
degree. If the closely allied double-pyramid type is taken with
it, we have 79 per cent of the 'contemplative' to 50 per cent,
of the 'active' ones. This view is confirmed by contrasting the
'Adoration,' the most complete example of one group, with
the genre pictures, the most complete example of the other&mdash;and
here we see that in the first all are pyramidal, and in the
second only 26 per cent. A class which might be supposed to
suggest the same treatment in composition is that of the portraits&mdash;absolute
lack of action being the rule. And we find,
indeed, that no single type is represented within it except the
pyramid and double-pyramid, with 86 per cent. of the former.
Thus it is evident that for the type of picture which expresses
<span class="pagenum">[534]</span><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534"></a>the highest degree of quietude, contemplation, concentration,
the pyramid is the characteristic type of composition.</p>

<p>But is it not also characteristic of the 'active' pictures,
since, as we see, it has the largest representation in that class
too? Perhaps it might be said that, inasmuch as all pictures
are really more 'quiet' than they are 'active,' so the type <i>par
excellence</i> is the pyramidal&mdash;a suggestion which is certainly
borne out by the table as a whole. But setting aside for the
moment the pyramid and its sub-variety, we see that the diagonal
V-shaped and square types are much more numerous in
the roughly outlined 'active' class. Taking, again, the genre
class as especially representative, we find 23 per cent. of the
diagonal type, and 25 per cent. of the V-shaped. We have
seen how closely allied are these two types, and how gradually
one passes over into the other, so that we may for the nonce
take them together as making up 47 per cent. of the whole.
The type of picture which expresses the highest degree of activity,
which aims to tell a story, has, then, for its characteristic
type the V and its varieties.</p>

<p>The landscape picture presents a somewhat different problem.
It cannot be described as either 'active' or 'passive,' inasmuch
as it does not express either an attitude or an event.
There is no definite idea to be set forth, no point of concentration,
as with the altarpieces and the portraits, for instance; and
yet a unity is demanded. An examination of the proportions

<p>It is now necessary to ask what must be the interpretation of
the use of these types of composition. Must we consider the
pyramid the expression of passivity, the diagonal or V, of activity?
But the greatly predominating use of the second for
landscapes would remain unexplained, for at least nothing can
be more reposeful than the latter. It may aid the solution of
the problem to remember that the composition taken as a whole
has to meet the demand for unity, at the same time that it allows
free play to the natural expression of the subject. The altarpiece
<span class="pagenum">[535]</span><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535"></a>has to bring about a concentration of attention to express
or induce a feeling of reverence. This is evidently brought
about by the suggestion of the converging lines to the fixation
of the high point in the picture&mdash;the small area occupied by the
Madonna and Child&mdash;and by the subordination of the free play
of other elements. The contrast between the broad base and the
apex gives a feeling of solidity, of repose; and it seems not unreasonable
to suppose that the tendency to rest the eyes above
the center of the picture directly induces the associated mood of
reverence or worship. Thus the pyramidal form serves two
ends; primarily that of giving unity; and secondarily, by the
peculiarity of its mass, that of inducing the feeling-tone appropriate
to the subject of the picture.</p>

<p>Applying this principle to the so-called 'active' pictures,
we see that the natural movement of attention between the different
'actors' in the picture must be allowed for, while yet
unity is secured. And it is clear that the diagonal type is just
fitted for this. The attention sweeps down from the high side
to the low, from which it returns through some backward suggestion
of lines or interest in the objects of the high side.
Action and reaction&mdash;movement and return of attention&mdash;is
inevitable under the conditions of this type; and this it is which
allows the free play&mdash;which, indeed, <i>constitutes</i> and expresses
the activity belonging to the subject, just as the fixation of the
pyramid constitutes the quietude of the religious picture. Thus
it is that the diagonal composition is particularly suited to
portray scenes of grandeur, and to induce a feeling of awe in
the spectator, because only here can the eye rove in one large
sweep from side to side of the picture, recalled by the mass and
interest of the side from which it moves. The swing of the
pendulum is here widest, so to speak, and all the feeling-tones
which belong to wide, free movement are called into play. If,
at the same time, the element of the deep vista is introduced,
we have the extreme of concentration combined with the extreme
of movement; and the result is a picture in the 'grand
style'&mdash;comparable to high tragedy&mdash;in which all the feeling-tones
which wait on motor impulses are, as it were, while yet
in the same reciprocal relation, tuned to the highest pitch.<span class="pagenum">[536]</span><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536"></a>
Such a picture is the <i>Finding of the Ring</i>, Paris Bordone
(1048), in the Venice Academy. All the mass and the interest
and the suggestion of attention is toward the right&mdash;the sweep
of the downward lines and of the magnificent perspective
toward the left&mdash;and the effect of the whole space-composition
is of superb largeness of life and feeling. With it may be
compared Titian's <i>Presentation of the Virgin</i> (107), also in the
Academy, Venice. The composition, from the figure moving
upward to one high on the right, to the downward lines, waiting
groups and deep vista on the left, is almost identical with
that of the Bordone. Neither is pure diagonal&mdash;that is, it
saves itself at last by an upward movement. Compare also the
two great compositions by Veronese, <i>Martyrdom of St. Mark</i>,
etc. (1091), in the Doge's Palace, Venice, and <i>Esther before
Ahasuerus</i> (566), in the Uffizi, Florence. In both, the mass,
direction of interest, movement and attention are toward the
left, while all the lines tend diagonally to the right, where a
vista is also suggested&mdash;the diagonal making a V just at the
end. Here, too, the effect is of magnificence and vigor.</p>

<p>If, then, the pyramid belongs to contemplation, the diagonal
to action, what can be said of the type of landscape? It is
without action, it is true, and yet does not express that positive
quality, that <i>will</i> not to act, of the rapt contemplation. The
landscape uncomposed is negative; and it demands unity. Its
type of composition, then, must give it something positive
besides unity. It lacks both concentration and action; but it
can gain them both from a space composition which shall
combine unity with a tendency to movement. And this is given
by the diagonal and V-shaped type. This type merely allows
free play to the natural tendency of the 'active' picture; but it
constrains the neutral, inanimate landscape. The shape itself
imparts motion to the picture: the sweep of line, the concentration
of the vista, the unifying power of the inverted triangle between
two masses, act, as it were, externally to the suggestion of
the object itself. There is always enough quiet in a landscape&mdash;the
overwhelming suggestion of the horizontal suffices for
that; it is movement that is needed for richness of effect; and,
as I have shown, no type imparts the feeling of movement so
<span class="pagenum">[537]</span><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537"></a>strongly as the diagonal and V-shaped type of composition. It
is worth remarking that the perfect V, which is of course more
regular, concentrated, quiet, than the diagonal, is more frequent
than the diagonal among the 'Miscellaneous Religious'
pictures (that is, it is more <i>needed</i>), since after all, as has been
said, the final aim of all space composition is just the attainment
of repose. But the landscapes need energy, not repression;
and so the diagonal type is proportionately more numerous.</p>

<p>The square and oval types, as is seen from the table, are far
less often used. The oval, most infrequent of all, appears only
among the 'active' pictures, with the exception of landscape.
It usually serves to unite a group of people among whom there
is no one especially striking&mdash;or the object of whose attention
is in the center of the picture, as in the case of the Descent from
the Cross. It imparts a certain amount of movement, but an
equable and regular one, as the eye returns in an even sweep
from one side to the other.</p>

<p>The square type, although only three per cent. of the whole
number of pictures, suggests a point of view which has already
been touched on in the section on Primitive Art. The examples
fall into two classes: in the first, the straight lines
across the picture are unrelieved by the suggestion of any other
type; in the second, the pyramid or V is suggested in the background
with more or less clearness by means of architecture or
landscape. In the first class are found, almost exclusively,
early examples of Italian, Dutch and German art; in the second,
pictures of a later period. The rigid square, in short, is
found only at an early stage in the development of composition.
Moreover, all the examples are 'story' pictures, for the most
part scenes from the lives of the saints, etc. Many of them are
double-center&mdash;square, that is, with a slight break in the
middle, the grouping purely logical, to bring out the relations
of the characters. Thus, in the <i>Dream of Saint Martin</i>, Simone
Martini (325), a fresco at Assisi, the saint lies straight
across the picture with his head in one corner. Behind him on
one side, stand the Christ and angels, grouped closely together,
their heads on the same level. Compare also the <i>Finding of
the Cross</i>, Piero della Francesca (1088), a serial picture in two
<span class="pagenum">[538]</span><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538"></a>parts, with their respective backgrounds all on the same level;
and most of the frescoes by Giotto at Assisi&mdash;in particular <i>St.
Francis before the Sultan</i> (1057), in which the actors are divided
into parties, so to speak.</p>

<p>These are all, of course, in one sense symmetrical&mdash;in the
weight of interest, at least&mdash;but they are completely amorphous
from an &aelig;sthetic point of view. The <i>forms</i>, that is, do not
count at all&mdash;only the meanings. The story is told by a clear
separation of the parts, and as, in most stories, there are two
principal actors, it merely happens that they fall into the two
sides of the picture. Interesting in connection with this is the
observation that, although the more anecdotal the picture the
more likely it is to be 'double-centered,' the later the picture
the less likely it is to be double-centered. Thus the square and
the double-center composition seem often to be found in the
same picture and to be, both, characteristic of early composition.
On the other hand, a rigid geometrical symmetry is also
characteristic, and these two facts seem to contradict each other.
But it is to be noted, first, that the rigid geometrical symmetry
belongs only to the Madonna Enthroned, and general Adoration
pieces; and secondly, that this very rigidity of symmetry in
details can coexist with variations which destroy balance. Thus,
in the <i>Madonna Enthroned</i>, Giotto (715), where absolute symmetry
in detail is kept, the Child sits far out on the right knee of
the Madonna. Compare also <i>Madonna</i>, Vitale di Bologna (157),
in which the C. is almost falling off M.'s arms to the right, her
head is bent to the right, and a monk is kneeling at the right
lower corner; also <i>Madonna</i>, Ottaviano Nelli (175)&mdash;all very
early pictures. Hence, it would seem that the symmetry of
these early pictures was not dictated by a conscious demand for
symmetrical arrangement, or rather for real balance, else such
failures would hardly occur. The presence of geometrical
symmetry is more easily explained as the product, in large part,
of technical conditions: of the fact that these pictures were
painted as altarpieces to fill a space definitely symmetrical in
character&mdash;often, indeed, with architectural elements intruding
into it. We may even venture to connect the Madonna pictures
with the temple images of the classic period, to explain why
<span class="pagenum">[539]</span><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539"></a>it was natural to paint the object of worship seated exactly facing
the worshipper. Thus we may separate the two classes of
pictures, the one giving an object of worship, and thus taking
naturally, as has been said, the pyramidal, symmetrical shape,
and being moulded to symmetry by all other suggestions o
technique; the other aiming at nothing except logical clearness.
This antithesis of the symbol and the story has a most interesting
parallel in the two great classes of primitive art&mdash;the one symbolic,
merely suggestive, shaped by the space it had to fill, and
so degenerating into the slavishly symmetrical, the other descriptive,
'story-telling' and without a trace of space composition.
On neither side is there evidence of direct &aelig;sthetic feeling.
Only in the course of artistic development do we find the rigid,
yet often unbalanced, symmetry relaxing into a free substitutional
symmetry, and the formless narrative crystallizing into a
really unified and balanced space form. The two antitheses
approach each other in the 'balance' of the masterpieces of
civilized art&mdash;in which, for the first time, a real feeling for
space composition makes itself felt.</p>

<h2><a name="AES4" id="AES4"></a>THE &AElig;STHETICS OF UNEQUAL DIVISION.</h2>

<h4>BY ROSWELL PARKER ANGIER.</h4>


<h3>PART I.</h3>

<p>The present paper reports the beginnings of an investigation
designed to throw light on the psychological basis of our
&aelig;sthetic pleasure in unequal division. It is confined to horizontal
division. Owing to the prestige of the golden section,
that is, of that division of the simple line which gives a short
part bearing the same ratio to the long part that the latter bears
to the whole line, experimentation of this sort has been fettered.
Investigators have confined their efforts to statistical records
of approximations to, or deviations from, the golden section.
This exalts it into a possible &aelig;sthetic norm. But such a gratuitous
supposition, by limiting the inquiry to the verification
of this norm, distorts the results, tempting one to forget the provisional
nature of the assumption, and to consider divergence
from the golden section as an error, instead of another example,
merely, of unequal division. We have, as a matter of fact, on
one hand, investigations that do not verify the golden section,
and, on the other hand, a series of attempts to account for our
pleasure in it, as if it were, beyond dispute, the norm. In this
way the statistical inquiries have been narrowed in scope, and
interpretation retarded and misdirected. Statistically our aim
should be to ascertain within how wide limits &aelig;sthetically
pleasing unequal divisions fall; and an interpretative principle
must be flexible enough to include persistent variations from
any hypothetical norm, unless they can be otherwise accounted
for. If it is not forced on us, we have, in either case, nothing
to do with the golden section.</p>

<p>Since Fechner, the chief investigation in the &aelig;sthetics of
simple forms is that of Witmer, in 1893.<a name="FNanchor_1_143" id="FNanchor_1_143"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_1_143'>1</a> Only a small part
<span class="pagenum">[542]</span><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542"></a>of his work relates to horizontal division, but enough to show
what seems to me a radical defect in statistical method,
namely, that of accepting a general average of the average
judgments of the several subjects, as 'the most pleasing relation'
or 'the most pleasing proportion.'<a name="FNanchor_2_144" id="FNanchor_2_144"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_2_144'>2</a> Such a total average
may fall wholly without the range of judgments of every
subject concerned, and tells us nothing certain about the specific
judgments of any one. Even in the case of the individual subject,
if he shows in the course of long experimentation that he
has two distinct sets of judgments, it is not valid to say that his
real norm lies between the two; much less when several subjects
are concerned. If averages are data to be psychophysically
explained, they must fall well within actual individual
ranges of judgment, else they correspond to no empirically determinable
psychophysical processes. Each individual is a locus
of possible &aelig;sthetic satisfactions. Since such a locus is our
ultimate basis for interpretation, it is inept to choose, as 'the
most pleasing proportion,' one that may have no correspondent
empirical reference. The normal or ideal individual, which
such a norm implies, is not a psychophysical entity which may
serve as a basis of explanation, but a mathematical construction.</p>

<p>This criticism would apply to judgments of unequal division
on either side the center of a horizontal line. It would apply
all the more to any general average of judgments including both
sides, for, as we shall soon see, the judgments of individuals
differ materially on the two sides, and this difference itself may
demand its explanation. And if we should include within this
average, judgments above and below the center of a vertical
line, we should have under one heading four distinct sets of
averages, each of which, in the individual cases, might show
important variations from the others, and therefore require some
variation of explanation. And yet that great leveller, the
general average, has obliterated these vital differences, and is
recorded as indicating the 'most pleasing proportion.'<a name="FNanchor_3_145" id="FNanchor_3_145"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_3_145'>3</a> That
such an average falls near the golden section is immaterial.
<span class="pagenum">[543]</span><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543"></a>Witmer himself, as we shall see,<a name="FNanchor_4_146" id="FNanchor_4_146"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_4_146'>4</a> does not set much store by this
coincidence as a starting point for explanation, since he is averse
to any mathematical interpretation, but he does consider the
average in question representative of the most pleasing division.</p>

<p>I shall now, before proceeding to the details of the experiment
to be recorded, review, very briefly, former interpretative
tendencies. Zeising found that the golden section satisfied his
demand for unity and infinity in the same beautiful object.<a name="FNanchor_5_147" id="FNanchor_5_147"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_5_147'>5</a> In
the golden section, says Wundt,<a name="FNanchor_6_148" id="FNanchor_6_148"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_6_148'>6</a> there is a unity involving the
whole; it is therefore more beautiful than symmetry, according
to the &aelig;sthetic principle that that unification of spatial forms
which occurs without marked effort, which, however, embraces
the greater manifold, is the more pleasing. But to
me this manifold, to be &aelig;sthetic, must be a sensible manifold,
and it is still a question whether the golden section set of relations
has an actual correlate in sensations. Witmer,<a name="FNanchor_7_149" id="FNanchor_7_149"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_7_149'>7</a> however,
wrote, at the conclusion of his careful researches, that scientific
&aelig;sthetics allows no more exact statement, in interpretation of the
golden section, than that it forms 'die rechte Mitte' between a
too great and a too small variety. Nine years later, in 1902,
he says<a name="FNanchor_8_150" id="FNanchor_8_150"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_8_150'>8</a> that the preference for proportion over symmetry is not
a demand for an equality of ratios, but merely for greater
variety, and that 'the amount of unlikeness or variety that is
pleasing will depend upon the general character of the object,
and upon the individual's grade of intelligence and &aelig;sthetic taste.'
K&uuml;lpe<a name="FNanchor_9_151" id="FNanchor_9_151"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_9_151'>9</a> sees in the golden section 'a special case of the constancy
of the relative sensible discrimination, or of Weber's
law.' The division of a line at the golden section produces
'apparently equal differences' between minor and major, and
major and whole. It is 'the pleasingness of apparently equal
differences.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[544]</span><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544"></a>These citations show, in brief form, the history of the interpretation
of our pleasure in unequal division. Zeising and
Wundt were alike in error in taking the golden section as the
norm. Zeising used it to support a philosophical theory of the
beautiful. Wundt and others too hastily conclude that the mathematical
ratios, intellectually discriminated, are also sensibly
discriminated, and form thus the basis of our &aelig;sthetic pleasure.
An extension of this principle would make our pleasure in any
arrangement of forms depend on the mathematical relations of
their parts. We should, of course, have no special reason for
choosing one set of relationships rather than another, nor for
halting at any intricacy of formul&aelig;. But we cannot make experimental
&aelig;sthetics a branch of applied mathematics. A theory, if
we are to have psychological explanation at all, must be pertinent
to actual psychic experience. Witmer, while avoiding and
condemning mathematical explanation, does not attempt to
push interpretation beyond the honored category of unity in
variety, which is applicable to anything, and, in principle, is
akin to Zeising's unity and infinity. We wish to know what
actual psychophysical functionings correspond to this unity in
variety. K&uuml;lpe's interpretation is such an attempt, but it seems
clear that Weber's law cannot be applied to the division at the
golden section. It would require of us to estimate the difference
between the long side and the short side to be equal to that of
the long side and the whole. A glance at the division shows
that such complex estimation would compare incomparable facts,
since the short and the long parts are separated, while the long
part is inclosed in the whole. Besides, such an interpretation
could not apply to divisions widely variant from the golden
section.</p>

<p>This paper, as I said, reports but the beginnings of an
investigation into unequal division, confined as it is to results
obtained from the division of a simple horizontal line, and
to variations introduced as hints towards interpretation. The
tests were made in a partially darkened room. The apparatus
rested on a table of ordinary height, the part exposed to the subject
consisting of an upright screen, 45 cm. high by 61 cm.
broad, covered with black cardboard, approximately in the
<span class="pagenum">[545]</span><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545"></a>center of which was a horizontal opening of considerable size,
backed by opal glass. Between the glass and the cardboard,
flush with the edges of the opening so that no stray light could
get through, a cardboard slide was inserted from behind, into
which was cut the exposed figure. A covered electric light
illuminated the figure with a yellowish-white light, so that all
the subject saw, besides a dim outline of the apparatus and
the walls of the room, was the illuminated figure. An upright
strip of steel, 1&frac12; mm. wide, movable in either direction horizontally
by means of strings, and controlled by the subject,
who sat about four feet in front of the table, divided the horizontal
line at any point. On the line, of course, this appeared
as a movable dot. The line itself was arbitrarily made 160
mm. long, and 1&frac12; mm. wide. The subject was asked to
divide the line unequally at the most pleasing place, moving the
divider from one end slowly to the other, far enough to pass
outside any pleasing range, or, perhaps, quite off the line; then,
having seen the divider at all points of the line, he moved it
back to that position which appealed to him as most pleasing.
Record having been made of this, by means of a millimeter
scale, the subject, without again going off the line, moved to
the pleasing position on the other side of the center. He then
moved the divider wholly off the line, and made two more
judgments, beginning his movement from the other end of the
line. These four judgments usually sufficed for the simple line
for one experiment. In the course of the experimentation each
of nine subjects gave thirty-six such judgments on either side
the center, or seventy-two in all.</p>

<p>In Fig. 1, I have represented graphically the results of these
judgments. The letters at the left, with the exception of <i>X</i>,
mark the subjects. Beginning with the most extreme judgments
on either side the center, I have erected modes to represent
the number of judgments made within each ensuing five
millimeters, the number in each case being denoted by the figure
at the top of the mode. The two vertical dot-and-dash lines
represent the means of the several averages of all the subjects,
or the total averages. The short lines, dropped from each of
the horizontals, mark the individual averages of the divisions
<span class="pagenum">[546]</span><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546"></a>either side the center, and at <i>X</i> these have been concentrated
into one line. Subject <i>E</i> obviously shows two pretty distinct
fields of choice, so that it would have been inaccurate to condense
them all into one average. I have therefore given two
on each side the center, in each case subsuming the judgments
represented by the four end modes under one average. In
all, sixty judgments were made by <i>E</i> on each half the
line. Letter <i>E&sup1;</i> represents the first thirty-six; <i>E&sup2;</i> the full number.
A comparison of the two shows how easily averages shift;
how suddenly judgments may concentrate in one region after
having been for months fairly uniformly distributed. The introduction
of one more subject might have varied the total
averages by several points. Table I. shows the various averages
and mean variations in tabular form.</p>

<p>&sup1;These are <i>E</i>'s general averages on 36 judgments. Fig. 1, however, represents
two averages on each side the center, for which the figures are, on the left,

<p><span class="pagenum">[548]</span><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548"></a>Results such as are given in Fig. 1, appear to warrant the
criticism of former experimentation. Starting with the golden
section, we find the two lines representing the total averages
running surprisingly close to it. This line, however, out of a
possible eighteen chances, only twice (subjects <i>D</i> and <i>G</i>) falls
wholly within the mode representing the maximum number of
judgments of any single subject. In six cases (<i>C</i> twice, <i>F</i>, <i>H</i>,
<i>J</i> twice) it falls wholly without any mode whatever; and in
seven (<i>A</i>, <i>B</i> twice, <i>E</i>, <i>F</i>, <i>G</i>, <i>H</i>) within modes very near the
minimum. Glancing for a moment at the individual averages,
we see that none coincides with the total (although <i>D</i> is very
near), and that out of eighteen, only four (<i>D</i> twice, <i>G</i> twice)
come within five millimeters of the general average, while eight
(<i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>J</i> twice each, <i>F</i>, <i>H</i>) lie between ten and fifteen millimeters
away. The two total averages (although near the
golden section), are thus chiefly conspicuous in showing those
regions of the line that were avoided as not beautiful. Within
a range of ninety millimeters, divided into eighteen sections of
five millimeters each, there are ten such sections (50 mm.) each
of which represents the maximum of some one subject. The
range of maximum judgments is thus about one third the whole
line. From such wide limits it is, I think, a methodological error
to pick out some single point, and maintain that any explanation
whatever of the divisions there made interprets adequately our
pleasure in unequal division. Can, above all, the golden
section, which in only two cases (<i>D</i>, <i>G</i>) falls within the maximum
mode; in five (<i>A</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>F</i>, <i>J</i> twice) entirely outside all
modes, and in no single instance within the maximum on both
sides the center&mdash;can this seriously play the role of &aelig;sthetic
norm?</p>

<p>I may state here, briefly, the results of several sets of judgments
on lines of the same length as the first but wider, and on
other lines of the same width but shorter. There were not
enough judgments in either case to make an exact comparison
of averages valuable, but in three successively shorter lines,
only one subject out of eight varied in a constant direction,
making his divisions, as the line grew shorter, absolutely nearer
the ends. He himself felt, in fact, that he kept about the same
absolute position on the line, regardless of the successive shortenings,
made by covering up the ends. This I found to be
practically true, and it accounts for the increasing variation
toward the ends. Further, with all the subjects but one, two
out of three pairs of averages (one pair for each length of line)
bore the same relative positions to the center as in the normal
<span class="pagenum">[549]</span><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549"></a>line. That is, if the average was nearer the center on the left
than on the right, then the same held true for the smaller lines.
Not only this. With one exception, the positions of the averages
of the various subjects, when considered relatively to one another,
stood the same in the shorter lines, in two cases out of
three. In short, not only did the pair of averages of each subject
on each of the shorter lines retain the same relative positions as in
the normal line, but the zone of preference of any subject bore
the same relation to that of any other. Such approximations
are near enough, perhaps, to warrant the statement that the
absolute length of line makes no appreciable difference in the
&aelig;sthetic judgment. In the wider lines the agreement of the
judgments with those of the normal line was, as might be
expected, still closer. In these tests only six subjects were
used. As in the former case, however, <i>E</i> was here the exception,
his averages being appreciably nearer the center than in
the original line. But his judgments of this line, taken during
the same period, were so much on the central tack that a comparison
of them with those of the wider lines shows very close
similarity. The following table will show how <i>E</i>'s judgments
varied constantly towards the center:</p>

<table border="0" summary="">

<p>The measurements are always from the ends of the line. It
looks as if the judgments in (3) were pushed further to the center
by being immediately preceded by those on the shorter and the
wider lines, but those in (1) and (2) differ markedly, and yet
were under no such influences.</p>

<p>From the work on the simple line, with its variations in width
and length, these conclusions seem to me of interest. (1) The
records offer no one division that can be validly taken to represent
'the most pleasing proportion' and from which interpretation
may issue. (2) With one exception (<i>E</i>) the subjects, while
<span class="pagenum">[550]</span><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550"></a>differing widely from one another in elasticity of judgment, confined
themselves severally to pretty constant regions of choice,
which hold, relatively, for different lengths and widths of line.
(3) Towards the extremities judgments seldom stray beyond a
point that would divide the line into fourths, but they approach
the center very closely. Most of the subjects, however, found
a <i>slight</i> remove from the center disagreeable. (4) Introspectively
the subjects were ordinarily aware of a range within
which judgments might give equal pleasure, although a slight
disturbance of any particular judgment would usually be recognized
as a departure from the point of maximum pleasingness.
This feeling of potential elasticity of judgment, combined with
that of certainty in regard to any particular instance, demands&mdash;when
the other results are also kept in mind&mdash;an interpretative
theory to take account of every judgment, and forbids it
to seize on an average as the basis of explanation for judgments
that persist in maintaining their &aelig;sthetic autonomy.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to the interpretative part of the paper.
Bilateral symmetry has long been recognized as a primary
principle in &aelig;sthetic composition. We inveterately seek to
arrange the elements of a figure so as to secure, horizontally, on
either side of a central point of reference, an objective equivalence
of lines and masses. At one extreme this may be the rigid
mathematical symmetry of geometrically similar halves; at the
other, an intricate system of compensations in which size on one
side is balanced by distance on the other, elaboration of design
by mass, and so on. Physiologically speaking, there is here a
corresponding equality of muscular innervations, a setting free
of bilaterally equal organic energies. Introspection will localize
the basis of these in seemingly equal eye movements, in a
strain of the head from side to side, as one half the field is regarded,
or the other, and in the tendency of one half the body
towards a massed horizontal movement, which is nevertheless
held in check by a similar impulse, on the part of the other half,
in the opposite direction, so that equilibrium results. The
psychic accompaniment is a feeling of balance; the mind is
&aelig;sthetically satisfied, at rest. And through whatever bewildering
variety of elements in the figure, it is this simple bilateral
<span class="pagenum">[551]</span><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551"></a>equivalence that brings us to &aelig;sthetic rest. If, however, the
symmetry is not good, if we find a gap in design where we expected
a filling, the accustomed equilibrium of the organism
does not result; psychically there is lack of balance, and the
object is &aelig;sthetically painful. We seem to have, then, in symmetry,
three aspects. First, the objective quantitative equality
of sides; second, a corresponding equivalence of bilaterally
disposed organic energies, brought into equilibrium because
acting in opposite directions; third, a feeling of balance, which
is, in symmetry, our &aelig;sthetic satisfaction.</p>

<p>It would be possible, as I have intimated, to arrange a series
of symmetrical figures in which the first would show simple
geometrical reduplication of one side by the other, obvious at a
glance; and the last, such a qualitative variety of compensating
elements that only painstaking experimentation could make apparent
what elements balanced others. The second, through
its more subtle exemplification of the rule of quantitative
equivalence, might be called a higher order of symmetry.
Suppose now that we find given, objects which, &aelig;sthetically
pleasing, nevertheless present, on one side of a point of reference,
or center of division, elements that actually have none
corresponding to them on the other; where there is not, in short,
<i>objective</i> bilateral equivalence, however subtly manifested, but,
rather, a complete lack of compensation, a striking asymmetry.
The simplest, most convincing case of this is the horizontal
straight line, unequally divided. Must we, because of the
lack of objective equality of sides, also say that the bilaterally
equivalent muscular innervations are likewise lacking, and that
our pleasure consequently does not arise from the feeling of
balance? A new aspect of psychophysical &aelig;sthetics thus presents
itself. Must we invoke a new principle for horizontal unequal
division, or is it but a subtly disguised variation of the
more familiar symmetry? And in vertical unequal division,
what principle governs? A further paper will deal with vertical
division. The present paper, as I have said, offers a theory
for the horizontal.</p>

<p>To this end, there were introduced, along with the simple
line figures already described, more varied ones, designed to
<span class="pagenum">[552]</span><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552"></a>suggest interpretation. One whole class of figures was tried
and discarded because the variations, being introduced at the
ends of the simple line, suggested at once the up-and-down
balance of the lever about the division point as a fulcrum, and
became, therefore, instances of simple symmetry. The parallel
between such figures and the simple line failed, also, in the lack
of homogeneity on either side the division point in the former, so
that the figure did not appear to center at, or issue from the
point of division, but rather to terminate or concentrate in the
end variations. A class of figures that obviated both these difficulties
was finally adopted and adhered to throughout the work.
As exposed, the figures were as long as the simple line, but
of varying widths. On one side, by means of horizontal parallels,
the horizontality of the original line was emphasized, while
on the other there were introduced various patterns (fillings).
Each figure was movable to the right or the left, behind a stationary
opening 160 mm. in length, so that one side might be
shortened to any desired degree and the other at the same time
lengthened, the total length remaining constant. In this way
the division point (the junction of the two sides) could be made
to occupy any position on the figure. The figures were also
reversible, in order to present the variety-filling on the right or
the left.</p>

<p>If it were found that such a filling in one figure varied from
one in another so that it obviously presented more than the
other of some clearly distinguishable element, and yielded divisions
in which it occupied constantly a shorter space than the
other, then we could, theoretically, shorten the divisions at will
by adding to the filling in the one respect. If this were true it
would be evident that what we demand is an equivalence of
fillings&mdash;a shorter length being made equivalent to the longer
horizontal parallels by the addition of more of the element in
which the two short fillings essentially differ. It would then be
a fair inference that the different lengths allotted by the various
subjects to the short division of the simple line result from varying
degrees of substitution of the element, reduced to its simplest
terms, in which our filling varied. Unequal division
would thus be an instance of bilateral symmetry.<span class="pagenum">[553]</span><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553"></a></p>

<p>The thought is plausible. For, in regarding the short part
of the line with the long still in vision, one would be likely,
from the &aelig;sthetic tendency to introduce symmetry into the
arrangement of objects, to be irritated by the discrepant
inequality of the two lengths, and, in order to obtain the
equality, would attribute an added significance to the short
length. If the assumption of bilateral equivalence underlying
this is correct, then the repetition, in quantitative terms, on one
side, of what we have on the other, constitutes the unity in the
horizontal disposition of &aelig;sthetic elements; a unity receptive
to an almost infinite variety of actual visual forms&mdash;quantitative
identity in qualitative diversity. If presented material resists
objective symmetrical arrangement (which gives, with the minimum
expenditure of energy, the corresponding bilateral equivalence
of organic energies) we obtain our organic equivalence
in supplementing the weaker part by a contribution of energies
for which it presents no obvious visual, or objective, basis.
From this there results, by reaction, an objective equivalence,
for the psychic correlate of the additional energies freed is an
attribution to the weaker part, in order to secure this feeling of
balance, of some added qualities, which at first it did not appear
to have. In the case of the simple line the lack of objective
symmetry that everywhere meets us is represented by an
unequal division. The enhanced significance acquired by the
shorter part, and its psychophysical basis, will engage us
further in the introspection of the subjects, and in the final
paragraph of the paper. In general, however, the phenomenon
that we found in the division of the line&mdash;the variety of divisions
given by any one object, and the variations among the
several subjects&mdash;is easily accounted for by the suggested theory,
for the different subjects merely exemplify more fixedly
the shifting psychophysical states of any one subject.</p>

<p>In all, five sets of the corrected figures were used. Only
the second, however, and the fifth (chronologically speaking)
appeared indubitably to isolate one element above others, and
gave uniform results. But time lacked to develop the fifth sufficiently
to warrant positive statement. Certain uniformities
appeared, nevertheless, in all the sets, and find due mention in
<span class="pagenum">[554]</span><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554"></a>the ensuing discussion. The two figures of the second set are
shown in Fig. 2. Variation No. III. shows a design similar to
that of No. II., but with its parts set more closely together and
offering, therefore, a greater complexity. In Table II. are
given the average divisions of the nine subjects. The total
length of the figure was, as usual, 160 mm. Varying numbers
of judgments were made on the different subjects.</p>

<p>With the complex fillings at the left, it will be seen, firstly,
that in every case the left judgment on No. III. is less than that
on No. II. With the figures reversed, the right judgments on
No. III. are less than on No. II., with the exception of subjects
<i>E</i> and <i>H</i>. Secondly, four of the subjects only (<i>E</i>, <i>F</i>, <i>G</i> and
<i>H</i>) had judgments also on the side which gave the complex
filling the larger space; to <i>E</i>, <i>F</i> and <i>G</i>, these were secondary
<span class="pagenum">[555]</span><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555"></a>preferences; to <i>H</i> they were always primary. Thirdly, the
judgments on No. III. are less, in spite of the fact that the larger
component parts of No. II., might be taken as additional weight
to that side of the line, and given, therefore, the shorter space,
according to the principle of the lever.</p>

<p>The subjects, then, that appear not to substantiate our suggested
theory are <i>E</i> and <i>H</i>, who in the reversed figures give
the shorter space to the less complex filling, and <i>F</i> and <i>G</i>, who,
together with <i>E</i> and <i>H</i>, have always secondary judgments that
allot to either complex filling a larger space than to the simple
horizontal. Consider, first, subjects <i>E</i> and <i>H</i>. For each, the
difference in division of II. and III. is in any case very slight.
Further, subject <i>E</i>, in judgments where the complex filling
<i>exceeds</i> the horizontal parallels in length, still gives the more
complex of the two fillings markedly the shorter space, showing,
apparently, that its additional complexity works there in
accord with the theory. There was, according to his introspection,
another principle at work. As a figure, he emphatically
preferred II. to III. The filling of II. made up, he found,
by its greater interest, for lack of length. He here secured a
balance, in which the interest of the complex material compensated
for the greater <i>extent</i> of the simpler horizontals. This accounts
for its small variation from III., and even for its occupying
the smaller space. But in judgments giving the two
complex fillings the larger space, the more interesting material
<i>exceeded</i> in extent the less interesting. In such divisions the
balance was no longer uppermost in mind, but the desire to get
as much as possible of the interesting filling. To this end the
horizontal parallels were shortened as far as they could be without
becoming insignificant. But unless some element of balance
were there (although not present to introspection) each complex
filling, when up for judgment, would have been pushed to the
same limit. It, therefore, does seem, in cases where the complex
fillings occupied a larger space than the horizontals, that
the subject, not trying consciously to secure a balance of <i>interests</i>,
was influenced more purely by the factor of complexity,
and that his judgments lend support to our theory.</p>

<p>Subject H was the only subject who consistently <i>preferred</i><span class="pagenum">[556]</span><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556"></a>
to have all complex fillings occupy the larger space. Introspection
invariably revealed the same principle of procedure&mdash;he
strove to get as much of the interesting material as he could.
He thought, therefore, that in every case he moved the complex
filling to that limit of the pleasing range that he found on the
simple line, which would yield him most of the filling. Balance did
not appear prominent in his introspection. A glance, however,
at the results shows that his introspection is contradicted. For
he maintains approximately the same division on the right in all
the figures, whether reversed or not, and similarly on the left.
The average on the right for all four is 67; on the left it is 74.
Comparing these with the averages on the simple line, we see
that the right averages coincide exactly, while the left but
slightly differ. I suspect, indeed, that the fillings did not mean
much to <i>H</i>, except that they were 'interesting' or 'uninteresting';
that aside from this he was really abstracting from the
filling and making the same judgments that he would make on
the simple line. Since he was continually aware that they fell
within the 'pleasing range' on the simple line, this conclusion
is the more plausible.</p>

<p>Perhaps these remarks account for the respective uniformities
of the judgments of <i>E</i> and <i>H</i>, and their departure from the
tendency of the other subjects to give the more complex filling
constantly the shorter space. But subjects <i>F</i> and <i>G</i> also had
judgments (secondary with both of them) giving to the complex
filling a larger extent than to the parallels. With them one of
two principles, I think, applies: The judgments are either instances
of abstraction from the filling, as with <i>H</i>, or one of
simpler gravity or vertical balance, as distinguished from the
horizontal equivalence which I conceive to be at the basis of the
other divisions. With <i>F</i> it is likely to be the latter, since the
divisions of the figures under discussion do not approach very
closely those of the simple line, and because introspectively he
found that the divisions giving the complex the larger space were
'balance' divisions, while the others were determined with 'reference
to the character of the fillings.' From <i>G</i> I had no introspection,
and the approximation of his judgments to those he gave
for the simple line make it probable that with him the changes
<span class="pagenum">[557]</span><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557"></a>in the character of the filling had little significance. The
average of his judgments in which the complex filling held the
greater space is 66, while the averages on the simple line were
65 on the left, and 64 on the right. And, in general, abstraction
from filling was easy, and to be guarded against. Subject <i>C</i>,
in the course of the work, confessed to it, quite unsolicited, and
corrected himself by giving thenceforth <i>all</i> complex fillings
much smaller space than before. Two others noticed that it
was particularly hard not to abstract. Further, none of the
four subjects mentioned (with that possible exception of <i>E</i>)
showed a sensitiveness similar to that of the other five.</p>

<p>With the exception of <i>H</i>, and in accord with the constant
practice of the other five, these subjects, too, occasionally
found no pleasing division in which the complex filling preponderated
in length over the horizontals. It was uniformly
true, furthermore, in every variation introduced in the course of
the investigation, involving a complex and a simple filling, that
all the nine subjects but <i>H</i> <i>preferred</i> the complex in the
shorter space; that five refused any divisions offering it in the
larger space; that these five showed more sensitiveness to differences
in the character of fillings; and that with one exception
(<i>C</i>) the divisions of the simple line which these subjects
gave were nearer the ends than those of the others. It surely
seems plausible that those most endowed with &aelig;sthetic sensitiveness
would find a division near the center more unequal than
one nearer the end; for one side only slightly shorter than the
other would at once seem to mean the same thing to them, and
yet, because of the obvious difference in length, be something
markedly different, and they would therefore demand a part
short enough to give them sharp qualitative difference, with,
however, in some way, quantitative equivalence. When the short
part is too long, it is overcharged with significance, it strives to
be two things at once and yet neither in its fulness.</p>

<p>We thus return to the simple line. I have considered a
series of judgments on it, and a series on two different figures,
varying in the degree of complexity presented, in one of their
fillings. It remains very briefly to see if the introspection on
the simple line furnishes further warrant for carrying the complexities
<span class="pagenum">[558]</span><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558"></a>over into the simple line and so giving additional
validity to the outlined theory of substitution. The following
phrases are from introspective notes.</p>

<p><i>A</i>. Sweep wanted over long part. More attention to short.
Significance of whole in short. Certainly a concentration of
interest in the short. Short is efficacious. Long means rest;
short is the center of things. Long, an effortless activity;
short, a more strenuous activity. When complex fillings are
introduced, subject is helped out; does not have to put so much
into the short division. In simple line, subject <i>introduces</i> the
concentration. In complex figures the concentration is objectified.
In <i>equal</i> division subject has little to do with it; the <i>unequal</i>
depends on the subject&mdash;it calls for appreciation. Center
of references is the division point, and the eye movements to
right and left begin here, and here return. The line centers
there. The balance is a horizontal affair.</p>

<p><i>B</i>. Center a more reposing division. Chief attention to division
point, with side excursions to right and left, when refreshment
of perception is needed. The balance is horizontal and
not vertical.</p>

<p><i>C</i>. A balance with variety, or without symmetry. Centers
at division point and wants sweep over long part. More concentration
on short part. Subjective activity there&mdash;an introduction
of energy. A contraction of the muscles used in active
attention. Long side easier, takes care of itself, self-poised.
Line centers at division point. Active with short division. Introduces
activity, which is equivalent to the filling that the complex
figures have; in these the introduced activity is objectified&mdash;made
graphic.</p>

<p><i>D</i>. Focal point at division point: wants the interesting
things in a picture to occupy the left (when short division is also
on left). Short division the more interesting and means greater
complication. When the pleasing division is made, eyes move
first over long and then over short. Division point the center
of real reference from which movements are made.</p>

<p><i>E</i>. No reference to center in making judgments; hurries
over center. All portions of simple line of equal interest; but
in unequal division the short gets a non-apparent importance,
<span class="pagenum">[559]</span><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559"></a>for the line is then a scheme for the representation of materials
of different interest values. When the division is too short, the
imagination refuses to give it the proportionally greater importance
that it would demand. When too long it is too near
equality. In enjoying line, the division point is fixed, with
shifts of attention from side to side. An underlying intellectual
assignment of more value to short side, and then the sense-pleasure
comes; the two sides have then an equality.</p>

<p><i>F</i>. Middle vulgar, common, prosaic; unequal lively. Prefers
the lively. Eyes rest on division point, moving to the end
of long and then of short. Ease, simplicity and restfulness are
proper to the long part of complex figures. Short part of
simple line looks wider, brighter and more important than long.</p>

<p><i>G</i>. Unequal better than equal. Eye likes movement over
long and then over short. Subject interested only in division
point. Short part gives the &aelig;sthetic quality to the line.</p>

<p><i>H</i>. Center not wanted. Division point the center of interest.
(No further noteworthy introspection from <i>H</i>, but concerning
complex figures he said that he wanted simple or the
compact on the short, and the interesting on the long.)</p>

<p>These introspective notes were given at different times, and
any repetitions serve only to show constancy. The subjects were
usually very certain of their introspection. In general it appears
to me to warrant these three statements: (1) That the
center of interest is the division point, whence eye-movements,
or innervations involving, perhaps, the whole motor system, are
made to either side. (2) That there is some sort of balance
or equivalence obtained (a bilateral symmetry), which is not,
however, a vertical balance&mdash;that is, one of weights pulling
downwards, according to the principle of the lever. All
the subjects repudiated the suggestion of vertical balance.
(3) That the long side means ease and simplicity, and represents
graphically exactly what it means; that the short side
means greater intensity, concentration, or complexity, and that
this is substituted by the subject; the short division, unlike the
long, means something that it does not graphically represent.</p>

<p>So much for the relation between what is objectively given
and the significance subjectively attributed to it. There remains
<span class="pagenum">[560]</span><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560"></a>still the translation into psychophysical terms. The
results on the complex figures (showing that a division may be
shortened by making the innervations on that side increasingly
more involved) lend plausibility to the interpretation that
the additional significance is, in visual terms, a greater intricacy
or difficulty of eye-movement, actual or reproduced; or, in more
general terms, a greater tension of the entire motor system. In
such figures the psychophysical conditions for our pleasure in the
unequal division of the simple horizontal line are merely
graphically symbolized, not necessarily duplicated. On page
553 I roughly suggested what occurs in regarding the unequally
divided line. More exactly, this: the long section
of the line gives a free sweep of the eyes from the division
point, the center, to the end; or again, a free innervation
of the motor system. The sweep the subject makes sure of.
Then, with that as standard, the &aelig;sthetic impulse is to secure
an equal and similar movement, from the center, in the opposite
direction. It is checked, however, by the end point
of the short side. The result is the innervation of antagonistic
muscles, by which the impression is intensified. For
any given subject, then, the pleasing unequal division is at
that point which causes quantitatively equal physiological
discharges, consisting of the simple movement, on one hand,
and, on the other, the same kind of movement, compounded
with the additional innervation of the antagonists resulting
from the resistance of the end point. Since, when the characteristic
movements are being made for one side, the other
is always in simultaneous vision, the sweep receives, by contrast,
further accentuation, and the innervation of antagonists
doubtless begins as soon as movement on the short side is
begun. The whole of the short movement is, therefore, really
a resultant of the tendency to sweep and this necessary innervation
of antagonists. The correlate of the equivalent innervations
is equal sensations of energy of movement coming from
the two sides. Hence the feeling of balance. Hence (from the
lack of unimpeded movement on the short side) the feeling there
of 'intensity,' or 'concentration,' or 'greater significance.'
Hence, too, the 'ease,' the 'simplicity,' the 'placidity' of the
long side.<span class="pagenum">[561]</span><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561"></a></p>

<p>As in traditional symmetry, the element of unity or identity,
in unequal division, is a repetition, in quantitative terms, on one
side, of what is given on the other. In the simple line the
<i>equal</i> division gives us obviously exact objective repetition, so
that the psychophysical correlates are more easily inferred, while
the <i>unequal</i> offers apparently no compensation. But the psychophysical
contribution of energies is not gratuitous. The function
of the increment of length on one side, which in the centrally
divided line makes the divisions equal, is assumed in
unequal division by the end point of the short side; the uniform
motor innervations in the former become, in the latter, the additional
innervation of antagonists, which gives the equality. The
two are separated only in degree. The latter may truly be
called, however, a symmetry of a higher order, because objectively
the disposition of its elements is not graphically obvious,
and psychophysically, the quantitative unity is attained
through a greater variety of processes. Thus, in complex
works of art, what at first appears to be an unsymmetrical composition,
is, if beautiful, only a subtle symmetry. There is
present, of course, an arithmetically unequal division of horizontal
extent, aside from the filling. But our pleasure in this,
<i>without</i> filling, has been seen to be also a pleasure in symmetry.
We have, then, the symmetry of equally divided extents and of
unequally divided extents. They have in common bilateral
equivalence of psychophysical processes; the nature of these
differs. In both the principle of unity is the same. The variety
through which it works is different.</p>

CAMBARUS AFFINIS.<a name="FNanchor_1_152" id="FNanchor_1_152"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_1_152'>1</a></h2>

<h4>BY ROBERT M. YERKES AND GURRY E. HUGGINS.</h4>

<p><span class="pagenum">[565]</span><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565"></a>This paper is an account of some experiments made for the
purpose of testing the ability of the crawfish to profit by experience.
It is well known that most vertebrates are able to learn,
but of the invertebrates there are several classes which have not
as yet been tested.</p>

<p>The only experimental study of habit formation in a crustacean
which we have found is that of Albrecht Bethe<a name="FNanchor_2_153" id="FNanchor_2_153"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_2_153'>2</a> on the crab, <i>Carcinus
maenas</i>. In his excellent paper on the structure of the nervous
system of <i>Carcinus</i> Bethe calls attention to a few experiments
which he made to determine, as he puts it, whether the crab
possesses psychic processes. The following are the observations
made by him. Experiment I. A crab was placed in a
basin which contained in its darkest corner an <i>Eledone</i> (a
Cephalopod). The crab at once moved into the dark region
because of its instinct to hide, and was seized by the <i>Eledone</i>
and drawn under its mantle. The experimenter then quickly
freed the crab from its enemy and returned it to the other end
of the basin. But again the crab returned to the dark and was
seized. This was repeated with one animal five times and with
another six times without the least evidence that the crabs
profited by their experiences with the <i>Eledone</i>. Experiment 2.
Crabs in an aquarium were baited with meat. The experimenter
held his hand above the food and each time the hungry
crab seized it he caught the animal and maltreated it, thus trying
to teach the crabs that meat meant danger. But as in the
previous experiment several repetitions of the experience failed
to teach the crabs that the hand should be avoided. From these
observations Bethe concludes that <i>Carcinus</i> has no 'psychic
qualities' (<i>i.e.</i>, is unable to profit by experience), but is a reflex
machine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[566]</span><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566"></a>Bethe's first test is unsatisfactory because the crabs have a
strong tendency to hide from the experimenter in the darkest
corner. Hence, if an association was formed, there would
necessarily be a conflict of impulses, and the region in which
the animal would remain would depend upon the relative
strengths of its fear of the experimenter and of the <i>Eledone</i>.
This objection is not so weighty, however, as is that which must
obviously be made to the number of observations upon which
the conclusions are based. Five or even twenty-five repetitions
of such an experiment would be an inadequate basis for the
statements made by Bethe. At least a hundred trials should
have been made. The same objection holds in case of the
second experiment. In all probability Bethe's statements were
made in the light of long and close observation of the life habits
of <i>Carcinus</i>; we do not wish, therefore, to deny the value of
his observations, but before accepting his conclusions it is our
purpose to make a more thorough test of the ability of crustaceans
to learn.</p>

<p class="nosccaption"><span class="sc">Fig. 1.</span> Ground Plan of Labyrinth. <i>T</i>, triangular compartment from
which animal was started; <i>P</i>, partition at exit; <i>G</i>, glass plate closing one exit
passage. Scale 1/6.</p></div>

<p>For determining whether the crawfish is able to learn a
simple form of the labyrinth method was employed. A wooden
box (Fig. 1) 35 cm. long, 24 cm. wide and 15 cm. deep, with
<span class="pagenum">[567]</span><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567"></a>one end open, and at the other end a triangular compartment
which communicated with the main portion of the box by an
opening 5 cm. wide, served as an experiment box. At the open
end of this box a partition (<i>P</i>) 6 cm. long divided the opening
into two passages of equal width. Either of these passages
could be closed with a glass plate (<i>G</i>), and the subject thus
forced to escape from the box by the choice of a certain passage.
This box, during the experiments, was placed in the
aquarium in which the animals lived. In order to facilitate
the movement of the crawfish toward the water, the open end
was placed on a level with the water in the aquarium, and the
other end was raised so that the box made an angle of 6&deg; with
the horizontal.</p>

<p>Experiments were made under uniform conditions, as follows.
A subject was taken from the aquarium and placed in
a dry jar for about five minutes, in order to increase the desire
to return to the water; it was then put into the triangular space
of the experiment box and allowed to find its way to the aquarium.
Only one choice of direction was necessary in this,
namely, at the opening where one of the passages was closed.
That the animal should not be disturbed during the experiment
the observer stood motionless immediately behind the box.</p>

<p>Before the glass plate was introduced a preliminary series
of tests was made to see whether the animals had any tendency
to go to one side on account of inequality of illumination, of the
action of gravity, or any other stimulus which might not be
apparent to the experimenter. Three subjects were used, with
the results tabulated.</p>

</div>
<p>Since there were more cases of exit by the right-hand passage,
it was closed with the glass plate, and a series of experiments
made to determine whether the crawfish would learn to
avoid the blocked passage and escape to the aquarium by the
most direct path. Between March 13 and April 14 each of the
<span class="pagenum">[568]</span><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568"></a>three animals was given sixty trials, an average of two a day.
In Table I. the results of these trials are arranged in groups of
ten, according to the choice of passages at the exit. Whenever
an animal moved beyond the level of the partition (<i>P</i>) on the
side of the closed passage the trial was counted in favor of the
closed passage, even though the animal turned back before
touching the glass plate and escaped by the open passage.</p>

<div class="tblexp"><p>&sup1;The experiments of this table were made by F.D. Bosworth.</p>
<p>&sup2;One trial in which the subject failed to return to the water within thirty
minutes.</p></div>

<p>In these experiments there is a gradual increase in the
number of correct choices (<i>i.e.</i>, choice of the 'open' passage)
from 50 per cent. for the first ten trials to 90 per cent.
for the last ten (trials 51-60). The test of permanency, made
after two weeks, shows that the habit persisted.</p>

<p>Although the observations just recorded indicate the ability
of the crawfish to learn a simple habit, it seems desirable to
test the matter more carefully under somewhat different conditions.
For in the experiments described the animals were allowed
to go through the box day after day without any change
in the floor over which they passed, and as it was noted that
they frequently applied their antennae to the bottom of the box
as they moved along, it is possible that they were merely following
a path marked by an odor or by moistness due to the
previous trips. To discover whether this was really the case
<span class="pagenum">[569]</span><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569"></a>experiments were made in which the box was thoroughly
washed out after each trip.</p>

<p>The nature of the test in the experiments now to be recorded
is the same as the preceding, but a new box was used. Fig.
2 is the floor plan and side view of this apparatus. It was
44.5 cm. long, 23.5 cm. wide and 20 cm. deep. The partition
at the exit was 8.5 cm. in length. Instead of placing this apparatus
in the aquarium, as was done in the previous experiments,
a tray containing sand and water was used to receive
the animals as they escaped from the box. The angle of inclination
was also changed to 7&deg;. For the triangular space in
which the animals were started in the preceding tests a rectangular
box was substituted, and from this an opening 8 cm. wide by
5 cm. deep gave access to the main compartment of the box.</p>

<p>A large healthy crawfish was selected and subjected to
tests in this apparatus in series of ten experiments given in
quick succession. One series a day was given. After each test
<span class="pagenum">[570]</span><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570"></a>the floor was washed; as a result the experiments were separated
from one another by a three-minute interval, and each
series occupied from thirty minutes to an hour. Table II. gives
in groups of five these series of ten observations each. The
groups, indicated by Roman numerals, run from I. to IX., there
being, therefore, 450 experiments in all. Groups I. and II., or
the first 100 experiments, were made without having either of
the exit passages closed, in order to see whether the animal
would develop a habit of going out by one side or the other.
It did very quickly, as a matter of fact, get into the habit of
using the left passage (L.). The last sixty experiments (Groups
I. and II.) show not a single case of escape by the right passage.
The left passage was now closed. Group III. gives the
result. The time column (<i>i.e.</i>, the third column of the table)
gives for each series of observations the average time in seconds
occupied by the animal in escaping from the box. It is to
be noted that the closing of the Left passage caused an increase
in the time from 30.9 seconds for the last series of the second
group to 90 seconds for the first series of the third group. In
this there is unmistakable evidence of the influence of the
change in conditions. The animal after a very few experiences
under the new conditions began going to the Right in most cases;
and after 250 experiences it had ceased to make mistakes.
Group VII. indicates only one mistake in fifty choices.</p>

<p class="tblexp">The dotted lines at the beginning of groups indicate the closed passage.</p>


<p>At the beginning of Group VIII. the Right instead of the
Left passage was closed in order to test the ability of the animal
to change its newly formed habit. As a result of this
change in the conditions the animal almost immediately began
going to the Left. What is most significant, however, is the
fact that in the first trial after the change it was completely confused
and spent over fifteen minutes wandering about, and trying
to escape by the old way (Fig. 4 represents the path taken).
At the end of the preceding group the time of a trip was about
48 seconds, while for the first ten trips of Group VIII. the time
increased to 147 seconds. This remarkable increase is due almost
entirely to the great length of time of the first trip, in which
the animal thoroughly explored the whole of the box and made
persistent efforts to get out by the Right passage as it had been
accustomed to do. It is at the same time noteworthy that the
average time for the second series of Group VIII. is only 26
seconds.</p>

<p>For Group IX. the conditions were again reversed, this time
the Left passage being closed. Here the first trial was one of
long and careful exploration, but thereafter no more mistakes
were made in the first series, and in the group of fifty tests
there were only five wrong choices.</p>

<p>The fifth column, R. L. and L. R., of Table II. contains
cases in which the subject started toward one side and then
changed its course before reaching the partition. In Group
III., for instance, when the Left passage was closed, the subject
started toward the Left seven times, but in each case
changed to the Right before reaching the partition. This is
the best evidence of the importance of vision that these experiments
furnish.<span class="pagenum">[573]</span><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573"></a></p>

<p>The first experiments on habit formation proved conclusively
that the crawfish is able to learn. The observations which
have just been described prove that the labyrinth habit is not
merely the following of a path by the senses of smell, taste
or touch, but that other sensory data, in the absence of those
mentioned, direct the animals. So far as these experiments go
there appear to be at least four sensory factors of importance
in the formation of a simple labyrinth habit: the chemical
sense, touch, vision and the muscle sense. That the chemical
sense and touch are valuable guiding senses is evident from
even superficial observation, and of the importance of vision
and the muscle sense we are certain from the experimental
evidence at hand.</p>

passage. Marks along the glass plate and partition indicate contact by the antennae
and chel&aelig;.</p></div>

<p>Of the significance of the sensations due to the 'direction of
turning' in these habits the best evidence that is furnished by
this work is that of the following observations. In case of the
tests of Table II. the subject was, after 100 preliminary tests,
trained by 250 experiences to escape by the Right-hand passage.
Now, in Groups III. to VII., the subject's usual manner
of getting out of the closed passage, when by a wrong choice
it happened to get into it, was to draw back on the curled
abdomen, after the antennae and chel&aelig; had touched the glass
plate, and then move the chel&aelig; slowly along the Right wall of
the partition until it came to the upper end; it would then walk
around the partition and out by the open passage. Fig. 3
represents such a course. In Group VIII. the Right passage was
closed, instead of the Left as previously. The first time the
animal tried to get out of the box after this change in the conditions
<span class="pagenum">[574]</span><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574"></a>it walked directly into the Right passage. Finding this
closed it at once turned to the Right, <i>as it had been accustomed to
do when it came in contact with the glass plate</i>, and moved along
the side of the box just as it did in trying to get around the end
of the partition. The path taken by the crawfish in this experiment
is represented in Fig. 4. It is very complex, for the
animal wandered about more than fifteen minutes before
escaping.</p>

<p>The experiment just described to show the importance of
the tendency to turn in a certain direction was the first one of
the first series after the change in conditions. When given its
second chance in this series the subject escaped directly by the
Left passage in 33 seconds, and for the three following trips the
time was respectively 25, 25 and 30 seconds.</p>

<p>Upon the experimental evidence presented we base the conclusion
that crawfish are able to profit by experience in much
the same way that insects do, but far more slowly.</p>

<p>It was thought that a study of the way in which crawfish
right themselves when placed upon their backs on a smooth surface
might furnish further evidence concerning the ability of
the animals to profit by experience.</p>

<p>Dearborn<a name="FNanchor_3_154" id="FNanchor_3_154"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_3_154'>3</a> from some observations of his concludes that there
is no one method by which an individual usually rights itself,
and, furthermore, that the animals cannot be trained to any one
method. His experiments, like Bethe's, are too few to warrant
any conclusions as to the possibility of habit formation.</p>

<p>For the following experiments the subject was placed on its
<span class="pagenum">[575]</span><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575"></a>back on a smooth surface in the air and permitted to turn over
in any way it could. Our purpose was to determine (1) whether
there was any marked tendency to turn in a certain way, (2)
whether if such was not the case a tendency could be developed
by changing the conditions, and (3) how alteration in the conditions
of the test would affect the turning.</p>

<p>A great many records were taken, but we shall give in detail
only a representative series. In Table III., 557 tests
made upon four subjects have been arranged in four groups for
convenience of comparison of the conditions at different
periods of the training process. Each of these groups, if perfect,
would contain 40 tests for each of the four subjects, but as
a result of accidents II., III., and IV. are incomplete.</p>

<p>Group I., representing 163 tests, shows 59 per cent. to the
right, with a time interval of 10.8 seconds (<i>i.e.</i>, the time occupied
in turning). Group II. shows 77 per cent. to the right; and so
throughout the table there is an increase in the number of returnings
to the right. These figures at first sight seem to indicate
the formation of a habit, but in such case we would expect,
<span class="pagenum">[576]</span><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576"></a>also, a shortening of the time of turning. It may be, however,
that the animals were gradually developing a tendency to turn
in the easiest manner, and that at the same time they were becoming
more accustomed to the unusual position and were no
longer so strongly stimulated, when placed on their backs, to
attempt to right themselves.</p>

<p>All the subjects were measured and weighed in order to discover
whether there were inequalities of the two sides of the
body which would make it easier to turn to the one side than to
the other. The chel&aelig; were measured from the inner angle of
the joint of the protopodite to the angle of articulation with the
dactylopodite. The carapace was measured on each side, from
the anterior margin of the cephalic groove to the posterior extremity
of the lateral edge. The median length of the carapace
was taken, from the tip of the rostrum to the posterior edge,
and the length of the abdomen was taken from this point to the
edge of the telson. These measurements, together with the
weights of three of the subjects, are given in the accompanying
table.</p>

<p>Since these measurements indicate slightly greater size on
the right it is very probable that we have in this fact an explanation
of the tendency to turn to that side.</p>

<p>To test the effect of a change in the conditions, No. 16 was
tried on a surface slanted at an angle of 1&deg; 12'. Upon this
surface the subject was each time so placed that the slant would
favor turning to the right. Under these conditions No. 16 gave
the following results in two series of tests. In the first series,
consisting of 46 turns, 82.6 per cent. were to the right, and the
average time for turning was 17.4 seconds; in the second series,
of 41 tests, there were 97.5 per cent, to the right, with an average
time of 2.5 seconds. We have here an immediate change
in the animal's method of re-turning caused by a slight change
<span class="pagenum">[577]</span><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577"></a>in the conditions. The subject was now tested again on a level
surface, with the result that in 49 tests only 59 per cent. were
toward the right, and the time was 15 seconds.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY.</h3>


<p>1. Experiments with crawfish prove that they are able to
learn simple labyrinth habits. They profit by experience rather
slowly, from fifty to one hundred experiences being necessary
to cause a perfect association.</p>

<p>2. In the crawfish the chief factors in the formation of such
habits are the chemical sense (probably both smell and taste),
touch, sight and the muscular sensations resulting from the
direction of turning. The animals are able to learn a path
when the possibility of following a scent is excluded.</p>

<p>3. The ease with which a simple labyrinth habit may be
modified depends upon the number of experiences the animal
has had; the more familiar the animal is with the situation, the
more quickly it changes its habits. If the habit is one involving
the choice of one of two passages, reversal of the conditions
confuses the subject much more the first time than in subsequent
cases.</p>

<p>4. Crawfish right themselves, when placed on their backs,
by the easiest method; and this is found to depend usually upon
the relative weight of the two sides of the body. When placed
upon a surface which is not level they take advantage, after a
few experiences, of the inclination by turning toward the lower
side.</p>

<h2><a name="ANI2" id="ANI2"></a>THE INSTINCTS, HABITS, AND REACTIONS
OF THE FROG.</h2>

<h4>BY ROBERT MEARNS YERKES.</h4>


<h3>PART I. THE ASSOCIATIVE PROCESSES OF THE
GREEN FROG.</h3>


<h4>I. SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GREEN FROG.</h4>

<p>The common green frog, <i>Rana clamitans</i>, is greenish or
brownish in color, usually mottled with darker spots. It is
much smaller than the bull frog, being from two to four inches
in length ordinarily, and may readily be distinguished from it
by the presence of prominent glandular folds on the sides of
the back. In the bull frog, <i>Rana catesbeana</i>, these folds are
very small and indistinct. The green frog is found in large
numbers in many of the ponds and streams of the eastern
United States, and its peculiar rattling croak may be heard from
early spring until fall. It is more active, and apparently
quicker in its reactions, than the bull frog, but they are in many
respects similar in their habits. Like the other water frogs it
feeds on small water animals, insects which chance to come
within reach and, in times of famine, on its own and other
species of frogs. The prey is captured by a sudden spring and
the thrusting out of the tongue, which is covered with a viscid
secretion. Only moving objects are noticed and seized; the
frog may starve to death in the presence of an abundance of
food if there is no movement to attract its attention. Most
green frogs can be fed in captivity by swinging pieces of meat
in front of them, and those that will not take food in this way
can be kept in good condition by placing meat in their mouths,
for as soon as the substance has been tasted swallowing follows.</p>

<p>The animals used for these experiments were kept in the
laboratory during the whole year in a small wooden tank. The
bottom of this tank was covered with sand and small stones,
<span class="pagenum">[580]</span><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580"></a>and a few plants helped to purify the water. An inch or two
of water sufficed; as it was not convenient to have a constant
stream, it was changed at least every other day. There was no
difficulty whatever in keeping the animals in excellent condition.</p>

<p>Of the protective instincts of the green frog which have
come to my notice during these studies two are of special
interest: The instinctive inhibition of movement under certain
circumstances, and the guarding against attack or attempt to
escape by 'crouching' and 'puffing.' In nature the frog
ordinarily jumps as soon as a strange or startling object comes
within its field of vision, but under certain conditions of excitement
induced by strong stimuli it remains perfectly quiet, as do
many animals which feign death, until forced to move. Whether
this is a genuine instinctive reaction, or the result of a sort of
hypnotic condition produced by strong stimuli, I am not prepared
to say. The fact that the inhibition of movement is most frequently
noticed after strong stimulation, would seem to indicate
that it is due to the action of stimuli upon the nervous system.</p>

<p>What appears to be an instinctive mode of guarding against
attack and escaping an enemy, is shown whenever the frog is
touched about the head suddenly, and sometimes when strong
stimuli are applied to other parts of the body. The animal
presses its head to the ground as if trying to dive or dodge
something, and inflates its body. This kind of action is supposed
to be a method of guarding against the attack of snakes
and other enemies which most frequently seize their prey from
the front. It is obvious that by pressing its head to the ground
the frog tends to prevent any animal from getting it into its
mouth, and in the few instants' delay thus gained it is able to
jump. This is just the movement necessary for diving, and it
is probable that the action should be interpreted in the light of
that instinctive reflex. The 'puffing' also would seem to
make seizure more difficult. Another fact which favors this
interpretation is that the response is most commonly given to
stimuli which seem to come from the front and which for this
reason could not easily be escaped by a forward jump, while if
the stimulus is so given that it appears to be from the rear the
animal usually jumps away immediately. We have here a
<span class="pagenum">[581]</span><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581"></a>complex protective reaction which may be called a forced movement.
It is, so far as one can see, very much like many
reflexes, although it does not occur quite so regularly.</p>

<p>The machine-like accuracy of many of the frog's actions
gives a basis for the belief that the animal is merely an automaton.
Certain it is that one is safe in calling almost all the frog's
actions reflex or instinctive. During months of study of the
reaction-time of the frog I was constantly impressed with the
uniformity of action and surprised at the absence of evidences
of profiting by experience. In order to supplement the casual
observations on the associations of the green frog made in the
course of reaction-time experiments, the tests described in this
paper were made. They do not give a complete view of the
associative processes, but rather such a glimpse as will enable
us to form some conception of the relation of the mental life of
the frog to that of other animals. This paper presents the outlines
of work the details of which I hope to give later.</p>


<h3>II. EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF HABITS.</h3>


<p>A. The Chief Problems for which solutions were sought in
the following experimental study were: (1) Those of associability
in general, its characteristics, and the rapidity of learning;
(2) of discrimination, including the parts played in associative
processes by the different senses, and the delicacy of discrimination
in each; (3) of the modifiability of associational reactions
and general adaptation in the frog, and (4) of the permanency
of associations.</p>


<p>B. Simple Associations, as studied in connection with reaction-time
work, show that the green frog profits by experience
very slowly as compared with most vertebrates. The animals have
individual peculiarities in reaction which enable one in a short
time to recognize any individual. To these characteristic peculiarities
they stick tenaciously. One, for instance, always jumps
upward when strongly stimulated; another has a certain corner
of the tank in which it prefers to sit. Their habits are remarkably
strong and invariable, and new ones are slowly formed.
While using a large reaction box I noticed that the frogs, after
having once escaped from an opening which could be made by
<span class="pagenum">[582]</span><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582"></a>pushing aside a curtain at a certain point in the box, tended to
return to that place as soon as they were again put into the box.
This appeared to be evidence of an association; but the fact
that such stimuli as light and the relation of the opening to the
place at which the animals were put into the box might in themselves
be sufficient to direct the animals to this point without the
help of any associations which had resulted from previous experience,
makes it unsatisfactory. In addition to the possibility of
the action being due to specific sensory stimuli of inherent directive
value, there is the chance of its being nothing more than
the well-known phenomenon of repetition. Frogs, for some
reason, tend to repeat any action which has not proved harmful
or unpleasant.</p>

<p>For the purpose of more carefully testing this kind of association,
a small box with an opening 15 cm. by 10 cm. was arranged
so that the animal could escape from confinement in it
through the upper part of the opening, the lower portion being
closed by a plate of glass 10 cm. by 10 cm., leaving a space
5 cm. by 10 cm. at the top. One subject placed in this box
escaped in 5 minutes 42 seconds. After 5 minutes' rest it was
given another trial, and this time got out in 2 minutes 40
seconds. The times for a few subsequent trials were: Third,
1 minute 22 seconds; fourth, 4 minutes 35 seconds; fifth, 2
minutes 38 seconds; sixth, 3 minutes 16 seconds. Although
this seems to indicate some improvement, later experiments
served to prove that the frogs did not readily form any associations
which helped them to escape. They tended to jump
toward the opening because it was light, but they did not learn
with twenty or thirty experiences that there was a glass at the
bottom to be avoided. Thinking that there might be an insufficient
motive for escape to effect the formation of an association,
I tried stimulating the subject with a stick as soon as it
was placed in the box. This frightened it and caused violent
struggles to escape, but instead of shortening the time required
for escape it greatly lengthened it. Here was a case in which
the formation of an association between the appearance of the
upper part of the clear space and the satisfaction of escape from
danger would have been of value to the frog, yet there was no
<span class="pagenum">[583]</span><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583"></a>evidence of adaptation to the new conditions within a reasonably
short time. There can be little doubt that continuation of the
training would have served to establish the habit. This very
clearly shows the slowness of adaptation in the frog, in contrast
with the rapidity of habit formation in the cat or chick; and at
the same time it lends additional weight to the statement that
instinctive actions are all-important in the frog's life. A few
things it is able to do with extreme accuracy and rapidity, but
to this list new reactions are not readily added. When put
within the box described, an animal after having once escaped
would sometimes make for the opening as if it knew perfectly
the meaning of the whole situation, and yet the very next trial
it would wander about for half an hour vainly struggling to
escape.</p>

<p>A considerable number of simple experiments of this kind
were tried with results similar to those just given. The frog
apparently examines its surroundings carefully, and just when
the observer thinks it has made itself familiar with the situation
it reacts in such a way as to prove beyond doubt the absence of
all adaptation. In all these experiments it should be said, for
the benefit of any who may be trying similar work, that only
animals of exceptional activity were used. Most green frogs
when placed in the experiment box either sit still a great part
of the time or jump about for only a short time. It is very important
for studies of this kind, both on account of time saving
and the obtaining of satisfactory records, to have animals which
are full of energy and eager to escape when in confinement.
By choosing such subjects one may pretty certainly avoid all
unhealthy individuals, and this, it seems to me, counterbalances
the disadvantage of taking animals which may be unusually
quick in learning.</p>


<p>C. Complex Associations.</p>

<p>1. <i>Labyrinth Habits</i>.&mdash;A more thorough investigation of
the associative processes, sensory discrimination and the permanency
of impressions has been made by the labyrinth method.
A wooden box, 72 cm. long, 28 cm. wide and 28 cm. deep,
whose ground plan is represented by Fig. 1, served as the
framework for a simple labyrinth. At one end was a small
<span class="pagenum">[584]</span><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584"></a>covered box, <i>A</i>, from which the frog was allowed to enter the
labyrinth. This entrance passage was used in order that the
animal might not be directed to either side by the disturbance
caused by placing it in the box. <i>E</i>, the entrance, marks a
point at which a choice of directions was necessary. <i>P</i> is a movable
partition which could be used to close either the right or the
left passage. In the figure the right is closed, and in this case
if the animal went to the right it had to turn back and take the
left passage in order to get out of the box. A series of interrupted
electrical circuits, <i>IC</i>, covered the bottom of a portion
of the labyrinth; by closing the key, <i>K</i>, the circuit could be
made whenever a frog rested upon any two wires of the series.
When the frog happened to get into the wrong passage the key
was closed and the animal stimulated. This facilitated the
experiment by forcing the animal to seek some other way of
escape, and it also furnished material for an association. Having
passed through the first open passage, which for convenience
we may know as the entrance passage, the animal had to
choose again at the exit. Here one of the passages was closed
by a plate of glass (in the figure the left) and the other opened
into a tank containing water. The box was symmetrical and
the two sides were in all respects the same except for the following
variable conditions. At the entrance the partition on
one side changed the appearance, as it was a piece of board
which cut off the light. On either side of the entrance there
<span class="pagenum">[585]</span><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585"></a>were grooves for holding card-boards of any desired color.
The letters <i>R, R</i> mark sides which in this case were covered
with red; <i>W, W</i> mark white spaces. These pieces of cardboard
could easily be removed or shifted at any time. At the
exit the glass plate alone distinguished the sides, and it is not
likely that the animals were able to see it clearly. We have
thus at the entrance widely differing appearances on the two
sides, and at the exit similarity. The opening from <i>A</i> into the
large box was provided with a slide door so that the animal
could be prevented from returning to <i>A</i> after entering the labyrinth.
The partitions and the triangular division at the entrance
extended to the top of the box, 28 cm., so that the animals could
not readily jump over them.</p>

<p>The experiments were made in series of ten, with ten-minute
intervals between trials. In no case was more than one series
a day taken, and wherever a day was missed the fact has been
indicated in the tables. The only motive of escape from the
box depended upon was the animal's desire to return to the
water of the tank and to escape from confinement in the bright
light of the room. The tank was one in which the frogs had
been kept for several months so that they were familiar with it,
and it was as comfortable a habitat as could conveniently be
arranged. Usually the animals moved about almost constantly
until they succeeded in getting out, but now and then one
would remain inactive for long intervals; for this reason no
record of the time taken for escape was kept. On account of
the great amount of time required by experiments of this kind
I have been unable to repeat this series of experiments <i>in toto</i>
on several animals in order to get averages, but what is described
for a representative individual has been proved normal by test
observations on other animals. There are very large individual
differences, and it may well be that the subject of the series of
experiments herein described was above the average in ability
to profit by experience. But, however that may be, what is
demonstrated for one normal frog is thereby proved a racial
characteristic, although it may be far from the mean condition.</p>

<p>Before beginning training in the labyrinth, preliminary
observations were made to discover whether the animals had
<span class="pagenum">[586]</span><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586"></a>any tendencies to go either to the right or to the left. When
the colored cardboards were removed it was found that there
was usually no preference for right or left. In Table I. the
results of a few preliminary trials with No. 2 are presented.
For these the colors were used, but a tendency to the right
shows clearly. Trials 1 to 10 show choice of either the right
or the red throughout; that it was partly both is shown by trials
11 to 30, for which the colors were reversed. This individual
has therefore, to begin with, a tendency to the right at the
entrance. At the exit it went to the right the first time and
continued so to do for several trials, but later it learned by failure
that there was a blocked passage as well as an open one.
In the tables the records refer to choices. It was useless to
record time or to lay much stress upon the course taken, as it
was sometimes very complicated; all that is given, therefore, is
the action in reference to the passages. <i>Right</i> in every case
refers to the choice of the open way, and <i>wrong</i> to the choice
of the blocked passage. The paths taken improved steadily
in that they became straighter. A few representative courses
are given in this report. Usually if the animal was not disturbed
a few jumps served to get it out of the labyrinth.</p>

<p>This table indicates in trials 1 to 10 a strong tendency to the red cardboard.
Trials 21 to 30 prove that there was also a tendency to the right.</p>

<p>Training was begun with the labyrinth arranged as shown
in Fig. 1, that is, with the left entrance passage and the right
exit passage open, and with red cardboard on the right (red
was always on the side to be avoided) and white on the left.
Table II. contains the results of 110 trials with No. 2, arranged
according to right and wrong choice at the entrance and exit.<span class="pagenum">[587]</span><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587"></a>
Examination of this table shows a gradual and fairly regular
increase in the number of right choices from the first series to
the last; after 100 experiences there were practically no mistakes.</p>

<p>With another subject, No.<i>6a</i>, the results of Table III. were
obtained. In this instance the habit formed more slowly and to
all appearances less perfectly. Toward the end of the second
week of work <i>6a</i> showed signs of sickness, and it died within a
few weeks, so I do not feel that the experiments with it are entirely
trustworthy. During the experiments it looked as if the
animal would get a perfectly formed habit very quickly, but
when it came to the summing up of results it was obvious that
there had been little improvement.</p>

<p>2. <i>Rapidity of Habit Formation</i>.&mdash;As compared with other
vertebrates whose rapidity of habit formation is known, the frog
learns slowly. Experimental studies on the dog, cat, mouse,
chick and monkey furnish excellent evidence of the ability of
these animals to profit quickly by experience through the adapting
of their actions to new conditions. They all show marked
improvement after a few trials, and after from ten to thirty most
of them have acquired perfect habits. But the comparison of
the frog with animals which are structurally more similar to it
is of greater interest and value, and we have to inquire concerning
the relation of habit formation in the frog to that of
fishes and reptiles. Few experimental studies with these animals
have been made, and the material for comparison is therefore
very unsatisfactory. E.L. Thorndike<a name="FNanchor_1_155" id="FNanchor_1_155"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_1_155'>1</a> has demonstrated
<span class="pagenum">[589]</span><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589"></a>the ability of fishes to learn a labyrinth path. In his report no
statement of the time required for the formation of habit is
made, but from personal observation I feel safe in saying that
they did not learn more quickly than did the frogs of these
experiments. Norman Triplett<a name="FNanchor_2_156" id="FNanchor_2_156"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_2_156'>2</a> states that the perch learns
to avoid a glass partition in its aquarium after repeatedly
bumping against it. Triplett repeated Moebius' famous experiment,
and found that after a half hour's training three times a
week for about a month, the perch would not attempt to capture
minnows which during the training periods had been placed in
the aquarium with the perch, but separated from them by a
glass partition. Triplett's observations disprove the often repeated
statement that fishes do not have any associative processes,
and at the same time they show that the perch, at least,
learns rapidly&mdash;not so rapidly, it is true, as most animals, but
more so in all probability than the amphibia.</p>

<p>The only quantitative study of the associative processes of
reptiles available is some work of mine on the formation of
habits in the turtle.<a name="FNanchor_3_157" id="FNanchor_3_157"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_3_157'>3</a> In the light of that study I can say that
the turtle learns much more rapidly than do fishes or frogs.
Further observations on other species of turtles, as yet unpublished,
confirm this conclusion.</p>

<p>For the frog it is necessary to measure and calculate the
improvement in order to detect it at first, while with the turtle
or chick the most casual observer cannot fail to note the change
after a few trials. In connection with the quickness of the formation
of associations it is of interest to inquire concerning
their permanency. Do animals which learn slowly retain associations
longer? is a question to which no answer can as yet be
given, but experiments may readily be made to settle the matter.
I have tested the frog for permanency, and also the turtle, but
have insufficient data for comparison.</p>


<p>3. <i>Sensory Data Contributing to the Associations</i>.&mdash;Among
the most important of the sensory data concerned in the labyrinth
habit are the visual impressions received from the different
<span class="pagenum">[590]</span><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590"></a>colored walls, the slight differences in brightness of illumination
due to shadows from the partitions and the contrast in form of
the two sides of the labyrinth resulting from the use of the partitions,
and the muscular sensations dependent upon the direction
of turning. The experiments proved beyond question that
vision and the direction of turning were the all-important factors
in the establishment of the habit. At first it seemed as if the
direction of turning was the chief determinant, and only by experimenting
with colors under other conditions was I able to
satisfy myself that the animals did notice differences in the
appearance of their surroundings and act accordingly. In
Table IV. some results bearing on this point have been arranged.
To begin with, the habit of going to the left when the
red was on the right at the entrance had been established; then,
in order to see whether the colors influenced the choice, I reversed
the conditions, placing the red on the left, that is, on the
open-passage side. The results as tabulated in the upper part
of Table IV. show that the animals were very much confused
by the reversal; at the entrance where there were several
guiding factors besides the colors there were 50 per cent. of
mistakes, while at the exit where there were fewer differences
by which the animal could be directed it failed every time.
This work was not continued long enough to break up the old
habit and replace it by a new one, because I wished to make
use of the habit already formed for further experiments, and
also because the animals remained so long in the labyrinth
trying to find their way out that there was constant danger of
losing them from too prolonged exposure to the dry air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[591]</span><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591"></a>These experiments to test the effect of changing colors are
also of interest in that they show in a remarkable way the influence
of the direction of turning. The animal after succeeding
in getting around the first part of the labyrinth failed entirely
to escape at the exit. Here it should have turned to the left,
instead of the right as it was accustomed to, but it persisted in
turning to the right. Fig. 3 represents approximately the path
taken in the first trial; it shows the way in which the animal
persisted in trying to get out on the right. From this it is clear
that both vision and the complex sensations of turning are important.</p>

is, approximately, that taken by No. 2 in the first trial after the reversal of
conditions.</p></div>

<p>The latter part of Table IV. presents further evidence in
favor of vision. For these tests the colors alone were reversed.
Previous to the change the animal had been making no mistakes
whatever, thereafter there were four mistakes at the entrance
and none at the exit. Later, another experiment under the
<span class="pagenum">[592]</span><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592"></a>same conditions was made with the same animal, No. 2, with
still more pronounced results. In this case the animal went to
the white, that is, in this instance, into the blind alley, and
failed to get out; several times it jumped over to the left side
(the open-passage side) of the box but each time it seemed to be
attracted back to the white or repelled by the red, more probably
the latter, as the animal had been trained for weeks to
avoid the red. Concerning the delicacy of visual discrimination
I hope to have something to present in a later paper.</p>

<p>The tactual stimuli given by contact with the series of wires
used for the electrical stimulus also served to guide the frogs.
They were accustomed to receive an electrical shock whenever
they touched the wires on the blocked side of the entrance,
hence on this side the tactual stimulus was the signal for a painful
electrical stimulus. When the animal chose the open passage
it received the tactual stimulus just the same, but no shock
followed. After a few days' experimentation it was noted that
No. 2 frequently stopped as soon as it touched the wires,
whether on the open or the closed side. If on the closed side,
it would usually turn almost immediately and by retracing its
path escape by the open passage; if on the open side, it would
sometimes turn about, but instead of going back over the course
it had just taken, as on the other side, it would sit still for a few
seconds, as if taking in the surroundings, then turn again and
go on its way to the exit. This whole reaction pointed to the
formation of an association between the peculiar tactual sensation
and the painful shock which frequently followed it. Whenever
the tactual stimulus came it was sufficient to check the
animal in its course until other sensory data determined the
next move. When the wrong passage had been chosen the
visual data gotten from the appearance of the partition which
blocked the path and other characteristics of this side of the labyrinth
determined that the organism should respond by turning
back. When, on the other hand, the open passage had been
selected, a moment's halt sufficed to give sensory data which determined
the continuation of the forward movement. Although
this reaction did not occur in more than one tenth of the trials,
it was so definite in its phases as to warrant the statements here
<span class="pagenum">[593]</span><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593"></a>made. Fig. 4 gives the path taken by No. 2 in its 123d trial.
In this experiment both choices were correctly made, but when
the frog touched the wires on the open side it stopped short and
wheeled around; after a moment it turned toward the exit again,
but only to reverse its position a second time. Soon it turned
to the exit again, and this time started forward, taking a direct
course to the tank. The usual course for animals which had
thoroughly learned the way to the tank is that chosen in Fig. 5.</p>

<p>An interesting instance of the repetition of a reaction occurred
in these experiments. A frog would sometimes, when
it was first placed in the box, by a strong jump get up to the
edge; it seldom jumped over, but instead caught hold of the
edge and balanced itself there until exhaustion caused it to fall
or until it was taken away. Why an animal should repeat an
action of the nature of this is not clear, but almost invariably
the second trial resulted in the same kind of reaction. The
animal would stop at the same point in the box at which it had
previously jumped, and if it did not jump, it would look up as
if preparing to do so. Even after a frog had learned the way
to the tank such an action as this would now and then occur,
and almost always there would follow repetition in the manner
described.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[594]</span><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594"></a>4. <i>The Effect of Fear upon Habit Formation.</i>&mdash;A certain
amount of excitement undoubtedly promotes the formation of
associations, but when the animal is frightened the opposite is
true. I have no hesitation in stating that, in case of the green
frog, any strong disturbing stimulus retards the formation of
associations. Although the frogs gave little evidence of fear
by movements after being kept in the laboratory for a few
weeks, they were really very timid, and the presence of any
strange object influenced all their reactions. Quiescence, it is
to be remembered, is as frequently a sign of fear as is movement,
and one is never safe in saying that the frog is not disturbed
just because it does not jump. The influence of the
experimenter's presence in the room with the frogs which were
being tried in the labyrinth became apparent when the animals
were tried in a room by themselves. They escaped much more
quickly when alone. In order to keep records of the experiments
it was necessary for me to be in the room, but by keeping
perfectly quiet it was possible to do this without in any
objectionable way influencing the results. It may be, however,
that for this reason the learning is somewhat slower than it
would have been under perfectly natural conditions. Early in
this paper reference was made to the fact that the frog did not
learn to escape from a box with a small opening at some distance
from the floor if it was prodded with a stick. I do not
mean to say that the animal would never learn under such conditions,
but that they are unfavorable for the association of
stimuli and retard the process. This conclusion is supported by
some experiments whose results are tabulated at the bottom of
Table IV. In these trials the animal had been trained to go to
the left and to avoid red. At first ten trials were given in which
the frog was in no way disturbed. The result was eight right
choices and two wrong ones. For the next ten trials the frog
was touched with a stick and thus made to enter the labyrinth
<span class="pagenum">[595]</span><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595"></a>from the box, <i>A</i>. This gave five right and five wrong choices,
apparently indicating that the stimulus interfered with the
choice of direction. Several other observations of this nature
point to the same conclusion, and it may therefore be said that
fright serves to confuse the frog and to prevent it from responding
to the stimuli which would ordinarily determine its reaction.</p>

<p>5. <i>The Permanency of Associations.</i>&mdash;After the labyrinth
habit had been perfectly formed by No. 2, tests for permanency
were made, (1) after six days' rest and (2) after thirty days.
Table V. contains the results of these tests. They show that
for at least a month the associations persist. And although
there are several mistakes in the first trials after the intervals
of rest, the habit is soon perfected again. After the thirty-day
interval there were forty per cent. of mistakes at the exit
for the first series, and only 20 per cent. at the entrance. This
in all probability is explicable by the fact that the colors acted
as aids at the entrance, whereas at the exit there was no such
important associational material.</p>

<p>D. Association of Stimuli.&mdash;In connection with reaction-time
work an attempt was made to form an association between a
strong visual stimulus and a painful electrical shock, with negative
results. A reaction box, having a series of interrupted
circuits in the bottom like those already described for other experiments,
and an opening on one side through which a light
could be flashed upon the animal, served for the experiments.
The tests consisted in the placing of a frog on the wires and
then flashing an electric light upon it: if it did not respond to
the light by jumping off the wires, an electrical stimulus was
<span class="pagenum">[596]</span><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596"></a>immediately given. I have arranged in Table VI. the results
of several weeks' work by this method. In no case is there
clear evidence of an association; one or two of the frogs reacted
to the light occasionally, but not often enough to indicate
anything more than chance responses. At one time it looked
as if the reactions became shorter with the continuation of the
experiment, and it was thought that this might be an indication
of the beginning of an association. Careful attention to this
aspect of the results failed to furnish any satisfactory proof of
such a change, however, and although in the table statements
are given concerning the relative numbers of short and long
reactions I do not think they are significant.</p>

<p>To all appearances this is the same kind of an association
that was formed, in the case of the labyrinth experiments, between
the tactual and the electrical stimuli. Why it should not
have been formed in this case is uncertain, but it seems not improbable
that the light was too strong an excitement and thus
inhibited action. There is also the probability that the frog was
<span class="pagenum">[597]</span><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597"></a>constrained by being placed in a small box and having the experimenter
near.</p>


<h3>III. SUMMARY.</h3>


<p>1. The green frog is very timid and does not respond normally
to most stimuli when in the presence of any strange
object. Fright tends to inhibit movement.</p>

<p>2. That it is able to profit by experience has been proved by
testing it in simple labyrinths. A few experiences suffice for
the formation of simple associations; but in case of a series of
associations from fifty to a hundred experiences are needed for
the formation of a perfect habit.</p>

<p>3. Experiment shows that the frog is able to associate two
kinds of stimuli, <i>e.g.</i>, the peculiar tactual stimulus given by a
wire and a painful electric stimulus which in the experiments
followed the tactual. In this case the animal learns to jump
away, upon receiving the tactual stimulus, before the experimenter
gives the electric stimulus.</p>

<p>4. Vision, touch and the organic sensations (dependent upon
direction of turning) are the chief sensory factors in the associations.
The animals discriminate colors to some extent.</p>

<p>5. Perfectly formed habits are hard to change.</p>

<p>6. Fear interferes with the formation of associations.</p>

<p>7. Associations persist for at least a month.<span class="pagenum">[598]</span><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598"></a></p>


<h3>PART II. REACTION TIME OF THE GREEN FROG
TO ELECTRICAL AND TACTUAL STIMULI.</h3>


<h3>IV. THE PROBLEMS AND POSSIBILITIES OF COMPARATIVE
REACTION-TIME STUDIES.</h3>


<p>Animal reaction time is at present a new field of research
of evident importance and full of promise. A great deal of
time and energy has been devoted to the investigation of
various aspects of the time relations of human neural processes;
a multitude of interesting facts have been discovered
and a few laws established, but the results seem disproportionate
to the amount of patient labor expended. Physiologists
have determined the rate of transmission of the neural impulse
for a few animals, and rough estimates of the time required for
certain changes in the nervous system have been made, but this
is all we have to represent comparative study. Just the path of
approach which would seem most direct, in case of the time of
neural changes, has been avoided. Something is known of the
ontogenetic aspect of the subject, practically nothing of the
phylogenetic; yet, in the study of function the comparative
point of view is certainly as important as it is in the study of
structure. In calling attention to the importance of the study
of animal reaction time I would not detract from or minimize
the significance of human investigations. They are all of
value, but they need to be supplemented by comparative studies.</p>

<p>It is almost impossible to take up a discussion of the time
relations of neural processes without having to read of physiological
and psychological time. The time of nerve transmission,
we are told, is pure physiological time and has nothing
whatever to do with psychic processes; the time occupied by
the changes in brain centers is, on the contrary, psychological
time. At the very beginning of my discussion of this subject
I wish to have it clearly understood that I make no such
distinction. If one phase of the neural process be called physiological
time, with as good reason may all be so named. I
prefer, therefore, to speak of the time relations of the neural
process.<span class="pagenum">[599]</span><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599"></a></p>

<p>Of the value of reaction-time studies, one may well believe
that it lies chiefly in the way of approach which they open to
the understanding of the biological significance of the nervous
system. Certainly they are not important as giving us knowledge
of the time of perception, cognition, or association, except
in so far as we discover the relations of these various processes
and the conditions under which they occur most satisfactorily.
To determine how this or that factor in the environment influences
the activities of the nervous system, and in what way
system may be adjusted to system or part-process to whole, is
the task of the reaction-time investigator.</p>

<p>The problems of reaction time naturally fall within three
classes: Those which deal with (1) nerve transmission rates; (2)
the time relations of the spinal center activities, and (3) brain
processes. Within each of these groups there are innumerable
special problems for the comparative physiologist or psychologist.
Under class 1, for instance, there is the determining
of the rates of impulse transmission in the sensory and the motor
nerves, (<i>a</i>) for a variety of stimuli, (<i>b</i>) for different strengths of
each stimulus, (<i>c</i>) for different conditions of temperature, moisture,
nourishment, fatigue, etc., in case of each stimulus, (<i>d</i>)
and all this for hundreds of representative animals. From this
it is clear that lines of work are not lacking.</p>

<p>Closely related to these problems of rate of transmission are
certain fundamental problems concerning the nature of the nerve
impulse or wave. Whether there is a nerve wave, the reaction-time
worker has as favorable an opportunity to determine as
anyone, and we have a right to expect him to do something
along this line. The relations of the form of the nerve impulse
to the rhythm of vital action, to fatigue and to inhibition are
awaiting investigation. Some of the most important unsettled
points of psychology depend upon those aspects of neural activities
which we ordinarily refer to as phenomena of inhibition,
and which the psychologist is helpless to explain so long as the
physiological basis and conditions are not known.</p>

<p>Then, too, in the study of animals the relation of reaction
time to instincts, habits, and the surroundings of the subject are
to be noted. Variability and adaptability offer chances for extended
<span class="pagenum">[600]</span><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600"></a>biological inquiries; and it is from just such investigations
as these that biology has reason to expect much. The development
of activity, the relation of reflex action to instinctive, of impulsive
to volitional, and the value of all to the organism, should
be made clear by reaction-time study. Such are a few of the
broad lines of inquiry which are before the comparative student
of animal reaction time. It is useless to dwell upon the possibilities
and difficulties of the work, they will be recognized by
all who are familiar with the results of human studies.</p>

<p>In the study of the time relations of neural processes Helmholtz
was the pioneer. By him, in 1850, the rate of transmission
of the nerve impulse in the sciatic nerve of the frog was
found to be about 27 meters per second<a name="FNanchor_4_158" id="FNanchor_4_158"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_4_158'>4</a>.
Later Exner<a name="FNanchor_5_159" id="FNanchor_5_159"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_5_159'>5</a> studied
the time occupied by various processes in the nervous system of
the frog by stimulating the exposed brain in different regions
and noting the time which intervened before a contraction of
the gastrocnemius in each case. Further investigation of the
frog's reflex reaction time has been made by Wundt<a name="FNanchor_6_160" id="FNanchor_6_160"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_6_160'>6</a>, Krawzoff
and Langendorff<a name="FNanchor_7_161" id="FNanchor_7_161"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_7_161'>7</a>,
Wilson<a name="FNanchor_8_162" id="FNanchor_8_162"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_8_162'>8</a> and others, but in no case has the
method of study been that of the psychologist. Most of the
work has been done by physiologists who relied upon vivisectional
methods. The general physiology of the nervous
system of the frog has been very thoroughly worked up and the
papers of Sanders-Ezn<a name="FNanchor_9_163" id="FNanchor_9_163"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_9_163'>9</a>,
Goltz<a name="FNanchor_10_164" id="FNanchor_10_164"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_10_164'>10</a>,
Steiner<a name="FNanchor_11_165" id="FNanchor_11_165"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_11_165'>11</a>,
Schrader<a name="FNanchor_12_166" id="FNanchor_12_166"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_12_166'>12</a> and
Merzbacher<a name="FNanchor_13_167" id="FNanchor_13_167"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_13_167'>13</a>,
<a name="FNanchor_14_168" id="FNanchor_14_168"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_14_168'>14</a>
furnish an excellent basis for the interpretation of
the results of the reaction-time studies.</p>

<p>In the present investigation it has been my purpose to study
the reactions of the normal frog by the reaction-time methods of
the psychologist. Hitherto the amount of work done, the extent
of movements or some other change has been taken as a
measure of the influence of a stimulus. My problem is, What
are the time relations of all these reactions? With this problem
in mind I enter upon the following program: (1) Determination
of reaction time to electrical stimuli: (<i>a</i>) qualitative, (<i>b</i>)
quantitative, (<i>c</i>) for different strengths of current; (2) Determination
of reaction time to tactual stimuli (with the same variations);
(3) Auditory: (<i>a</i>) qualitative, (<i>b</i>) quantitative, with studies
on the sense of hearing; (4) Visual: (<i>a</i>) qualitative, (<i>b</i>)
quantitative, with observations concerning the importance of
this sense in the life of the frog, and (5) Olfactory: (<i>a</i>) qualitative,
(<i>b</i>) quantitative.</p>

<p>The present paper presents in rather bare form the results
thus far obtained on electrical, tactual, and auditory reaction
time; discussion of them will be deferred until a comparison
of the results for the five kinds of stimuli can be given.</p>


<h3>V. METHOD OF STUDY.</h3>


<p>The measurements of reaction time herein considered were
made with the Hipp Chronoscope. Cattell's 'Falling Screen'
or 'Gravity Chronoscope' was used as a control for the Hipp.
The Gravity Chronoscope consists of a heavy metal plate which
slides easily between two vertical posts, with electrical connections
so arranged that the plate, when released from the magnet
at the top of the apparatus, in its fall, at a certain point breaks
an electric circuit and at another point further down makes the
same circuit. The rate of fall of the plate is so nearly constant
that this instrument furnishes an accurate standard time with
which Hipp readings may be compared, and in accordance with
<span class="pagenum">[602]</span><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602"></a>which the Hipp may be regulated. For, since the rate of a
chronoscope varies with the strength of the current in use, with
the variations in temperature and with the positions of the
springs on the magnetic bar, it is always necessary to have some
standard for corrections. In these experiments the time of fall
of the gravity chronoscope plate, as determined by the graphic
method with a 500 S.V. electric tuning fork, was 125&sigma; (<i>i.e.</i>,
thousandths of a second).</p>

<p>This period, 125&sigma;, was taken as a standard, and each hour,
before the beginning of reaction-time experiments, the time of
the plate's fall was measured ten times with the Hipp, and for
any variation of the average thus obtained from 125&sigma;, the
standard, the necessary corrections were made by changing the
position of the chronoscope springs or the strength of the current.</p>

<p>The standard of comparison, 125&sigma;, is shorter than most of
the reaction times recorded, but since the time measured was
always that from the breaking to the making of the circuit
passing through the chronoscope it cannot be urged that there
were errors resulting from the difference of magnetization
which was caused by variations in the reaction time. But it is
evident that the danger from differences in magnetization, if
such exists, is not avoided in this way; instead, it is transferred
from the reaction time proper to the period of preparation immediately
preceding the reaction; for, from the moment the
chronoscope is started until the stimulus is given a current is
necessarily passing through the instrument. At a verbal signal
from the operator the assistant started the chronoscope; the
stimulus was then given by the operator, and the instrument
recorded the time from the breaking of the circuit, effected by
the stimulating apparatus, to the making of the circuit by the
reaction of the animal. Despite precautions to prevent it, the
period from the starting of the chronoscope to the giving of the
stimulus was variable, and errors were anticipated, but a number
of the tests proved that variations of even a second did not
cause any considerable error.</p>

<p>A fairly constant current for the chronoscope was supplied
by a six-cell 'gravity battery' in connection with two storage
<span class="pagenum">[603]</span><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603"></a>cells, <i>GB</i> (Fig. 6). This current could be used for two hours
at a time without any objectionable diminution in its strength.
The introduction of resistance by means of the rheostat, <i>R</i>, was
frequently a convenient method of correcting the chronoscope.</p>

<p>Fig. 6 represents the general plan of the apparatus used in
these experiments.</p>

<p>The general method of experimentation is in outline as follows:</p>

<p>1. At a 'ready' signal from the operator the assistant makes
the chronoscope circuit by closing a key, <i>K</i> (Fig. 6), and then
immediately starts the chronoscope.</p>

<p>2. Stimulus is given by the operator as soon as the chronoscope
is started, and by this act the chronoscope circuit is broken
and the record begun.</p>

<p>3. Animal reacts and by its movements turns a key, <i>RK</i>
(Fig. 6), thus making the chronoscope circuit and stopping the
record.<span class="pagenum">[604]</span><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604"></a></p>

<p>4. Assistant stops chronoscope and takes reading.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="./images/621-fig7.png" width="640" height="362" alt="FIG. 7" title="" />
<p class="nosccaption"><span class="sc">Fig. 7.</span> Reaction Key. <i>l</i>, lever swung on pivot; <i>p, p</i>, posts for contacts
with platinum plates on base; <i>b</i>, upright bar for string; <i>s</i>, spring for clamping
string; <i>w</i>, wheel to carry string; <i>c, c</i>, chronoscope circuit; 1 and 2, points
which are brought into contact by animal's reaction.</p></div>

<p>The steps of this process and the parts of the apparatus concerned
in each may be clearly conceived by reference to the
diagram given in Fig. 6. The various forms of stimulating apparatus
used and the modification of the method will be described
in the sections dealing with results. The same reaction key
was used throughout (see Fig. 7). Its essential features are a
lever <i>l</i>, pivoted in the middle and bearing a post at either end,
<i>p, p</i>. From the middle of this lever there projected upward a
small metal bar, <i>b</i>, through the upper part of which a string to
the animal ran freely except when it was clamped by the spring,
<i>s</i>. This string, which was attached to the subject's leg by
means of a light elastic band, after passing through the bar ran
over a wheel, <i>w</i>, and hung tense by reason of a five-gram
weight attached to the end. Until everything was in readiness
for an experiment the string was left free to move through the
bar so that movement of the animal was not hindered, but the
instant before the ready-signal was given it was clamped by
pressure on <i>s</i>. The diagram shows the apparatus arranged for
a reaction. The current is broken, since 1 and 2 are not in contact,
but a slight movement of the animal turns the lever enough
to bring 1 against 2, thus making the circuit and stopping the
<span class="pagenum">[605]</span><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605"></a>chronoscope. When the motor reaction of the subject was violent
the string pulled out of the clamp so that the animal was
free from resistance, except such as the string and weight offered.
The five-gram weight served to give a constant tension
and thus avoided the danger of error from this source. Between
experiments the weight was placed on the table in order
that there might be no strain upon the subject.</p>

<p>That the subject might be brought into a favorable position
for an experiment without being touched by the operator a
special reaction box was devised.</p>

<p>The animals used in these studies were specimens of <i>Rana
clamitans</i> which were kept in a tank in the laboratory throughout
the year.</p>


<h3>VI. ELECTRIC REACTION TIME.</h3>


<p>The reaction time to electrical stimuli was determined first
because it seemed probable that this form of the pain reaction
would be most useful for comparison with the auditory, visual,
olfactory and tactual reactions. In this paper only the electrical
and the tactual reaction times will be considered. The former
will be divided into two groups: (1) Those resulting from a
stimulus given by touching electrodes to the leg of the frog, and
(2) those gotten by having the frog resting upon wires through
which a current could be passed at any time.</p>

<p><i>Group 1 of the electrical reactions</i> were taken under the following
conditions. A reaction box about 40 cm. in diameter
was used. The mean temperature of the experimenting room
was about 20&deg; C. In all cases the string was attached to the
left hind leg of the frog, and the stimulus applied to the middle
of the gastrocnemius muscle of the right hind leg. Reaction
times were taken in series of ten, excluding those which were
imperfect. As the moistness of the skin affects the strength of
the electric stimulus received, it was necessary to moisten the
animal occasionally, but as it did not seem advisable to disturb
it after each experiment this was done at intervals of five minutes
throughout the series. Were it not for this precaution it
might be said that lengthening of the reaction times toward the
end of a series simply indicated the weakening of the stimulus
which resulted from the gradual drying of the skin. The stimulus
<span class="pagenum">[606]</span><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606"></a>in this group was applied by means of the stimulating apparatus
of Fig. 6. It is merely two wire electrodes which could
be placed upon the animal, with the additional device of a key
for the breaking of the chronoscope circuit the instant the stimulus
was given. The most serious objection to this method of
stimulating is that there is a tactual as well as an electrical stimulus.</p>

large variations, in the case of series 1, from 102 to
179&sigma;. In all these experiments such variation is unavoidable
because it is impossible to have the conditions uniform. A
very slight difference in the frog's position, which could not be
detected by the operator, might cause considerable difference in
the time recorded. Efforts were made to get uniform conditions,
but the results seem to show that there is still much to be
desired in this direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[608]</span><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608"></a>Early in the experiments it became evident that there were
three clearly defined types of reactions: there were a number
of reactions whose time was shorter than that of the ordinary
quick voluntary pain reaction, and there were also many whose
time was considerably longer. The first type it was thought
might represent the spinal reflex reaction time. For the purpose
of determining whether the supposition was true, at the
end of the series of experiments three of the frogs were killed
and their reflex reaction time noted. This was done by cutting
the spinal cord just back of the medulla, placing the animal on
an experimenting board close to the reaction key with the thread
from the key fastened to the left leg as in case of the previous
work and stimulating the gastrocnemius with an induced current
by the application of wire electrodes.</p>

<p>In Table IX. the reflex reaction times for the three animals
are given.</p>

<p>The following results obtained with frog <i>E</i> show that the
time of reaction increases with the increase in the time after
death. The average of 20 reactions by <i>E</i> taken an hour after
the cord had been cut was 45.5&sigma;; the average of 20 taken
twenty hours later was 55.85&sigma;.</p>

<p>As a rule the reflex reactions were but slightly variable in
time as is indicated by the accompanying series.</p>

<p>Throughout these experiments it was noticed that any stimulus
might cause (1) a twitch in the limb stimulated, or (2) a
twitch followed by a jump, or (3) a sudden jump previous to
which no twitch could be detected. And it soon appeared that
these types of reaction, as it seems proper to call them, would
have to be considered in any determination of the mean reaction
time. As proof of the type theory there is given (Fig. 8) a
graphic representation of 277 reactions to the electrical stimulus.<span class="pagenum">[609]</span><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609"></a></p>

<p class="nosccaption"><span class="sc">Fig 8:</span> Distribution of 277 reactions.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[610]</span><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610"></a>The column of figures at the left indicates the number of
reactions at any point. Below the base line are the classes.
For convenience of plotting the reactions have been grouped
into classes which are separated by 25&sigma;. Class 1 includes all
reactions between 1&sigma; and 25&sigma;, class 2 all from 25&sigma; to 50&sigma;, and
so on to 400&sigma;, thereafter the classes are separated by 100&sigma;. It
is noticeable that there is one well-marked mode at 75&sigma;. A
second mode occurs at 175&sigma;. This is the primary and in our
present work the chiefly significant mode, since it is that of the
quick instinctive reaction to a stimulus. At 500&sigma; there is a third
mode; but as such this has little meaning, since the reactions
are usually pretty evenly distributed from 300&sigma; on to 2000&sigma;; if
there is any grouping, however, it appears to be about 500&sigma; and
800&sigma;.</p>

<p>The first mode has already been called the reflex mode.
The short reactions referred to usually lie between 40&sigma; and 80&sigma;,
and since experiment has shown conclusively that the spinal
reflex occupies about 50&sigma;, there can be little doubt that the first
mode is that of the reflex reaction time.</p>

<p>The second mode represents those reactions which are the
result of central activity and control. I should be inclined to
argue that they are what we usually call the instinctive and impulsive
actions. And the remaining reactions represent such
as are either purely voluntary, if any frog action can be so described,
or, in other words, depend upon such a balancing of
forces in the brain as leads to delay and gives the appearance
of deliberate choice.</p>

<p>Everything points to some such classification of the types as
follows: (1) Stimuli strong enough to be injurious cause the
shortest possible reaction by calling the spinal centers into
action, or if not spinal centers some other reflex centers; (2)
slightly weaker stimuli are not sufficient to affect the reflex
mechanism, but their impulse passes on to the brain and quickly
discharges the primary center. There is no hesitation, but an
immediate and only slightly variable reaction; just the kind that
<span class="pagenum">[611]</span><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611"></a>is described as instinctive. As would be expected, the majority
of the frog's responses are either of the reflex or of this instinctive
type. (3) There is that strength of stimulus which is
not sufficient to discharge the primary center, but may pass to
centers of higher tension and thus cause a response. This increase
in the complexity of the process means a slower reaction,
and it is such we call a deliberate response. Precisely this
kind of change in neural action and in reaction time is at the
basis of voluntary action. And (4) finally, the stimulus may
be so weak that it will not induce a reaction except by repetition.
Just above this point lies the threshold of sensibility,
the determination of which is of considerable interest and importance.</p>

<p><i>Group 2 of the electrical reactions</i> consists of three series
taken to determine the relation of strength of stimulus to reaction
time. The conditions of experimentation differed from
those for group 1 in the following points: (1) The stimulus was
applied directly by the making of a circuit through wires upon
which the subject rested (Fig. 9); (2) the thread was attached
to the right hind leg; (3) the thread, instead of being kept at
the tension given by the 5-gram weight as in the former reactions,
was slackened by pushing the upright lever of the reaction
key one eighth of an inch toward the animal. This was
done in order to avoid the records given by the slight twitches
of the legs which precede the motor reaction proper. For this
reason the reactions of group 2 are not directly comparable
with those of group 1. Fig. 9 is the plan of the bottom of a
reaction box 15 cm. at one end, 30 cm. at the other, 60 cm.
long and 45 cm. deep. On the bottom of this, at one end, a
series of interrupted circuits were arranged as shown in the
figure. The wires were 1.2 cm. apart, and an animal sitting
anywhere on the series necessarily touched two or more, so that
when the stimulus key, X, was closed the circuit was completed
by the animal's body; hence, a stimulus resulted. The
stimulus key, X, was a simple device by which the chronoscope
circuit, <i>c, c</i>, was broken at the instant the stimulus circuit, <i>s, c</i>,
was made.</p>

<p>Cells of 'The 1900 Dry Battery' furnished the current used<span class="pagenum">[612]</span><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612"></a>
as a stimulus. Three different strengths of stimulus whose
relative values were 1, 2 and 4, were employed in the series 1,
2 and 3. Careful measurement by means of one of Weston's
direct-reading voltmeters gave the following values: 1 cell, 0.2
to 0.5 volt, 0.00001 to 0.00003 amp&egrave;re. This was used as the
stimulus for series 1. 2 cells, 0.5 to 1.0 volt, 0.00003 to 0.00006
amp&egrave;re. This was used for series 2. 4 cells, 1.2 to 1.8 volt,
0.00007 to 0.0001 amp&egrave;re. This was used for series 3.</p>

<p>The reactions now under consideration were taken in sets
of 24 in order to furnish evidence on the problem of fatigue.
The stimulus was given at intervals of one minute, and the subject
was moistened at intervals of ten minutes. To obtain 24
satisfactory reactions it was usually necessary to give from
thirty to forty stimulations. Five animals, numbers 1, 2, 4, 5,
and 6, served as subjects. They were green frogs whose size
and sex were as follows:</p>

<p>For most of these frogs a one-cell stimulus was near the
<span class="pagenum">[613]</span><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613"></a>threshold, and consequently the reaction time is extremely
variable. In Table X. an analysis of the reactions according to
the number of repetitions of the stimulus requisite for a motor
reaction has been made. Numbers 1 and 5 it will be noticed
reacted most frequently to the first stimulus, and for them 48
satisfactory records were obtained; but in case of the others
there were fewer responses to the first stimulus, and in the tabulation
of series 1 (Table XI.) averages are given for less than
the regular sets of 24 reactions each.</p>

<p>Table XI. is self-explanatory. In addition to the usual
averages, there is given the average for each half of the sets,
in order that the effect of fatigue may be noted. In general,
for this series, the second half is in its average about one third
longer than the first half. There is, therefore, marked evidence
of tiring. The mean reaction time for this strength
of stimulus is difficult to determine because of the extremely
great variations. At one time a subject may react immediately,
with a time of not over a fifth of a second, and at another
it may hesitate for as much as a second or two before reacting,
thus giving a time of unusual length. Just how many
and which of these delayed responses should be included
in a series for the obtaining of the mean reaction time to this
particular stimulus is an extremely troublesome question. It
is evident that the mode should be considered in this case rather
than the mean, or at least that the mean should be gotten by
reference to the mode. For example, although the reaction
times for the one-cell stimulus vary all the way from 150&sigma; to
1000&sigma; or more, the great majority of them lie between 200&sigma; and
400&sigma;. The question is, how much deviation from the mode
<span class="pagenum">[614]</span><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614"></a>should be allowed? Frequently the inclusion of a single long
reaction will lengthen the mean by 10&sigma; or even 20&sigma;. What is
meant by the modal condition and the deviation therefrom is
illustrated by the accompanying curve of a series of reaction
times for the electric stimulus of group I.</p>

<p>The column of figures at the left indicates the number of reactions;
that below the base line gives the reaction times in
classes separated by 10&sigma;. Of thirty-one reactions, seven are
here in the class 170&sigma;. This is the model class, and the mean
gotten by taking the average of 31 reactions is 162&sigma;. If the
mode had been taken to represent the usual reaction time in this
case, there would have been no considerable error. But suppose
now that in the series there had occurred a reaction of
800&sigma;. Should it have been used in the determination of the
mean? If so, it would have made it almost 30&sigma; greater, thus
removing it considerably from the mode. If not, on what
grounds should it be discarded? The fact that widely varying
results are gotten in any series of reactions, points, it would
seem, not so much to the normal variability as to accidental
differences in conditions; and the best explanation for isolated
reactions available is that they are due to such disturbing factors
as would decrease the strength of the stimulus or temporarily
inhibit the response. During experimentation it was possible
to detect many reactions which were unsatisfactory because
of some defect in the method, but occasionally when everything
appeared to be all right an exceptional result was gotten.
There is the possibility of any or all such results being due to
internal factors whose influence it should be one of the objects
of reaction-time work to determine; but in view of the fact
that there were very few of these questionable cases, and that
<span class="pagenum">[615]</span><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615"></a>in series I, for instance, the inclusion of two or three reactions
which stood isolated by several tenths of a second from the
mode would have given a mean so far from the modal condition
that the results would not have been in any wise comparable
with those of other series, those reactions which were entirely
isolated from the mode and removed therefrom by 200&sigma; have
been omitted. In series I alone was this needful, for in the
other series there was comparatively little irregularity.</p>

<p>The results of studies of the reaction time for the one-cell
electric stimulus appear in Table XI. The first column of this
table contains the average reaction time or mean for each subject.
Nos. 2 and 4 appeared to be much less sensitive to the
current than the others, and few responses to the first stimulus
could be obtained. Their time is longer than that of the others,
and their variability on the whole greater. Individual differences
are very prominent in the studies thus far made on the
frog. The one-cell stimulus is so near the threshold that it is
no easy matter to get a mean which is significant. Could the
conditions be as fully controlled as in human reaction time it
would not be difficult, but in animal work that is impossible.
No attempt has thus far been made to get the reaction time in
case of summation effects except in occasional instances, and
in so far as those are available they indicate no great difference
between the normal threshold reaction and the summation reaction,
but on this problem more work is planned.</p>

<p>There are large mean variations in Table XI., as would be
anticipated. Since the reactions were taken in sets of 24, the
means of each set as well as that of the total are given, and
also, in columns 4 and 5, the means of the first half and the
last half of each set.</p>

<p>A comparison of Tables XI., XII. and XIII. makes clear
the differences in reaction time correlated with differences in
the strength of an electric stimulus. For Table XI., series I,
the relative value of the stimulus was I; for Table XII., series
2, it was 2, and for Table XIII., series 3, it was 4. Throughout
the series from I to 3 there is a rapid decrease in the reaction
time and in the variability of the same. The reaction time for
stimulus I, the so-called threshold, is given as 300.9&sigma;; but of
<span class="pagenum">[616]</span><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616"></a>the three it is probably the least valuable, for reasons already
mentioned. The mean of the second series, stimulus 2, is
231.5&sigma; while that of the third, stimulus 4, is only 103.1&sigma;. This
great reduction in reaction time for the four-cell stimulus apparently
shows the gradual transition from the deliberate motor
reaction, which occurs only after complex and varied central
neural activities, and the purely reflex reaction, which takes
place as soon as the efferent impulse can cause changes in the
spinal centers and be transmitted as an afferent impulse to the
muscular system.</p>

<p class="tblexp">For each animal there are two sets of 24 reactions each.</p>

<p>The spinal reflex for a decapitated frog, as results previously
discussed show, is approximately 50&sigma;; and every time the four-cell
stimulus is given this kind of a reaction results. There is
a slight twitch of the legs, immediately after which the animal
jumps. Now for all these series the thread was slackened by
one eighth of an inch, but the reflex time was determined without
this slack. Calculation of the lengthening of the reaction
time due to the slack indicated it to be between 20 and 30&sigma;,
so if allowance be made in case of the reactions to the four-cell
stimulus, the mean becomes about 70&sigma;, or, in other words,
nearly the same as the spinal reflex. The conclusion seems
forced, therefore, that when a stimulus reaches a certain intensity
it produces the cord response, while until that particular
point is reached it calls forth central activities which result in
much longer and more variable reaction times. It was said
above that the series under consideration gave evidence of the
gradual transition from the reflex to the volitional in reaction
time. Is this true, or do we find that there are well-marked
types, between which reactions are comparatively rare? Examination
of the tables VII., VIII., IX., XI., XII. and XIII. will
show that between 70&sigma; and 150&sigma; there is a break. (In tables<span class="pagenum">[618]</span><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618"></a>
XI., XII. and XIII., allowance must always be made for the
slack in the thread, by subtracting 30&sigma;.) All the evidence furnished
on this problem by the electrical reaction-time studies is
in favor of the type theory, and it appears fairly clear that there
is a jump in the reaction time from the reflex time of 50-80&sigma;,
to 140 or 150&sigma;, which may perhaps be taken as the typical instinctive
reaction time. From 150&sigma; up there appears to be a
gradual lengthening of the time as the strength of the stimulus
is decreased, until finally the threshold is reached, and only by
summation effect can a response be obtained.</p>

<p>The most important averages for the three series have been
arranged in Table XIV. for the comparison of the different
subjects. Usually the reaction time for series 3 is about one
half as long as that for series 2, and its variability is also not
more than half as large. In the small variability of series 3 we
have additional reason for thinking that it represents reflexes,
for Table IX. gives the mean variation of the reflex as not more
than 8&sigma;, and the fact that the means of this series are in certain
cases much larger is fully explained by the greater opportunity
for variation afforded by the slack in the thread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[619]</span><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619"></a>A striking fact is that the averages for the first and last half
of sets of reactions differ more for the weak than for the strong
stimulus. One would naturally expect, if the increase were
a fatigue phenomenon purely, that it would be greatest for the
strongest stimulus; but the results force us to look for some other
conditions than fatigue. A stimulus that is sufficiently strong
to be painful and injurious to an animal forces an immediate
response so long as the muscular system is not exhausted; but
where, as in series 1 and 2 of the electrical stimulus, the stimulus
is not harmful, the reason for a sudden reaction is lacking
unless fear enters as an additional cause. Just as long as an
animal is fresh and unfamiliar with the stimulus there is a quick
reaction to any stimulus above the threshold, and as soon as a
few experiences have destroyed this freshness and taught the
subject that there is no immediate danger the response becomes
deliberate. In other words, there is a gradual transition from
the flash-like instinctive reaction, which is of vast importance
in the life of such an animal as the frog, to the volitional and
summation responses. The threshold electrical stimulus does
not force reactions; it is a request for action rather than a
demand, and the subject, although startled at first, soon becomes
accustomed to the experience and responds, if at all, in a very
leisurely fashion. The reaction time to tactual stimuli, soon
to be considered, was determined by giving a subject only three
or four stimulations a day; if more were given the responses
failed except on repetition or pressure; for this reason the data
on fatigue, or lengthening of reaction time toward the end of
a series, are wanting in touch. A few tests for the purpose of
discovering whether the time would lengthen in a series were
made with results very similar to those of the threshold electrical
stimulus; the chief difference lies in the fact that the
responses to touch fail altogether much sooner than do those to
the electrical stimulus. This, however, is explicable on the
ground that the latter is a stimulus to which the animal would
not be likely to become accustomed so soon as to the tactual.</p>

<p>If pure fatigue, that is, the exhaustion of the nervous or
muscular system, appears anywhere in this work, it is doubtless
<span class="pagenum">[620]</span><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620"></a>in series 3, for there we have a stimulus which is so strong as
to force response on penalty of death; the reaction is necessarily
the shortest possible, and, as a matter of fact, the motor
reaction (jump forward) here occupies little more time than the
leg-jerk of a decapitated frog. This probably indicates that
the reaction is a reflex, and that the slight increase in its length
over that of the spinal reflex is due to occasional cerebellar
origin; but of this there can be no certainly from the evidence
herewith presented. At any rate, there is no possibility of a
voluntary reaction to the strong current, and any changes in
the general character of the reaction time in a series will have
to be attributed to fatigue of the nervous or muscular systems.
The second halves of the sets of series 3 are 5 per cent. longer
than the first, and unless this is due to the partial exhaustion of
the nervous system it is hard to find an explanation of the fact.
Fatigue of the muscles concerned seems out of the question
because the reactions occur at the rate of only one per minute,
and during the rest interval any healthy and well-nourished
muscle would so far recover from the effect of contraction that
it would be able to continue the rhythmic action for long periods.</p>

<p>To the inquiry, Does fatigue in the experiments mean tiring
by the exhaustion of nerve energy, or is the lengthening in reaction
time which would naturally be attributed to tiring due to
the fact that experience has shown quick reaction to be unnecessary?
we shall have to reply that there is evidence in
favor of both as factors. There can be little doubt that in case
of the strong stimuli there is genuine fatigue which makes quick
reaction impossible; but at the same time it is certain that the
40 to 50 per cent. increase of the second half of sets in series 1
over the first half can not be due to fatigue, for the strain is
here evidently much less than for series 3. Rather, it would
seem that habituation instead of exhaustion is the all-important
cause of the difference in series 1 and 2. It becomes clear from
these considerations that the repetition of a stimulus can never
mean the repetition of an effect.<span class="pagenum">[621]</span><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621"></a></p>


<h3>VII. TACTUAL REACTION TIME.</h3>

<p>In the following work on the reactions to tactual stimulation
the subject was placed in a large reaction box with a thread
attached to one of its legs and passing to a reaction key, as in
the experiments already described. The box in which the subject
was confined was surrounded by movable cloth curtains to
prevent the animal's escape and at the same time permit the
experimenter to work without being seen by the frog.</p>

<p>Tactual stimulation was given by means of a hand key<a name="FNanchor_15_169" id="FNanchor_15_169"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_15_169'>15</a> similar
to that used for electrical stimulation which is represented
in Fig. 6. The touch key ended in a hard-rubber knob which
could be brought in contact with the skin of the subject. This
key was fixed to a handle of sufficient length to enable the
operator to reach the animal wherever it chanced to be sitting
in the reaction box. Stimulation was given by allowing the
rubber point of the touch key to come in contact with the skin
in the middle region of the subject's back. As soon as the
point touched the animal the chronoscope circuit was broken
by the raising of the upper arm of the key.</p>

<p>As a precaution against reactions to visual stimuli, which it
might well be supposed would appear since the subject could
not in every case be prevented from seeing the approaching
apparatus, the frog was always placed with its head away from
the experimenter so that the eyes could not readily be directed
toward the touch apparatus. Notwithstanding care in this matter,
a reaction occasionally appeared which was evidently due
to some disturbance preceding the tactual stimulus which served
as a warning or preparation for the latter. All such responses
were at once marked as questionable visual reactions and were
not included in the series of touch reactions proper.</p>

<p>As has been mentioned in connection with the discussion of
fatigue, it was found absolutely necessary to have the subjects
perfectly fresh and active, and for this purpose it was advisable
to give not more than three or four stimulations at any one time.
The subject was usually kept in the reaction box from 30 to 45
minutes, dependent upon the success of the experiments. As
<span class="pagenum">[622]</span><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622"></a>the work progressed it became evident that the responses to the
stimulus were becoming less and less certain and slower, that
the subjects were becoming accustomed to the novel experience
and no longer suffered the surprise which had been the cause
of the prompt reactions at first. It seemed best for this reason
not to continue the work longer than two weeks, and as a consequence
it was impossible to base the averages on more than
twenty reactions for each subject.</p>

<p>So far as the tension of the thread is concerned, the condition
for the tactual reaction time was the same as that for the
first group of electrical reaction-time experiments. In comparing
the tactual with the electrical of series 1, 2 and 3, allowance
must be made for the slack in the latter cases.</p>

<p>Selection of the tactual reaction times upon which the mean
is based, has been made with reference to the mode for each
set of experiments. Inspection of the curves given by the reactions
of each subject indicated that the great majority of the
responses lay between 100 and 300&sigma;, and that those which
were beyond these limits were isolated and, in all probability,
exceptional reactions due to some undetected variation in conditions
which should throw them out of the regular series. On
this account it was thought best to use only reactions between
100 and 300&sigma;.</p>

<p>For convenience of comparison, again, the averages for the
electrical reaction time of subjects <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, <i>E</i> and <i>F</i>, and
the same for the tactual reaction time of subjects 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
and 6 are herewith given together. All averages are for twenty
reactions, except for <i>D</i> and 5, for which there are ten.</p>

<p>Besides the usual determination for the tactual reaction-time
work on the six subjects named, there is given in Table XVI.
the electrical reaction time of these animals to a two-cell current.
Comparison of the electrical and tactual results are of
interest in this case because the mean variation for each is
about 34&sigma;, being 34.3&sigma;, for the electrical and 33.8&sigma;, for the
tactual.</p>

<h3>VIII. EQUAL VARIABILITY AS A CRITERION OF COMPARABILITY
OF REACTION TIME FOR DIFFERENT KINDS
OF STIMULI.</h3>

<p>Since variability as indicated in the study of the influence
of different strengths of electrical stimulus becomes less as the
stimulus increases, parity in variability for different stimuli
offers a basis for the comparison of reaction times. Certain it
is that there is no use in comparing the reaction times for different
senses or different qualities of stimuli unless the relative
values of the stimuli are taken into consideration; but how are
these values to be determined unless some such index as variability
is available? If the reaction time to tactual stimuli as
here presented is to be studied in its relation to the electrical
reaction time, it will mean little simply to say that the former
is longer than the latter, because the electrical reaction time
for a one-cell stimulus happens to be somewhat less than that
for the particular tactual stimulus used. For it is clear that
this tactual reaction time is really shorter than the reaction time
to a weak current. In making variability a basis of comparison
it must be assumed that the strength of stimulus is the important
factor, and that all other variable conditions are, so far as possible,
excluded. If, now, on the basis of parity in variability
we compare the tactual and electrical reaction times, it is apparent
<span class="pagenum">[624]</span><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624"></a>that the tactual is considerably longer. The tactual
average of Table XV. is 205.7&sigma;, while the electrical reaction
time which has approximately the same variability is 172.1&sigma;.
It may well be objected that I have no right to make variability
the basis of my comparison in these experiments, because the
work for the various kinds of stimuli was done under different
conditions. Admitting the force of this objection, and at the
same time calling attention to the fact that I do not wish to lay
any stress on the results of the comparisons here made, I take
this opportunity to call attention to the possibility of this criterion.</p>

<p>The use of variability as a basis of comparison would involve
the assumptions (1) that a certain intensity of every
stimulus which is to be considered is capable of producing the
shortest possible, or reflex reaction, and that this reaction is at
the same time the least variable; (2) that as the strength of a
stimulus decreases the variability increases until the threshold is
reached.</p>

<p>Suppose, now, it is our desire to compare the results of reactions
to different intensities of electrical and tactual stimuli;
let the figures be as follows:</p>

<p>In the double columns the results for electrical stimuli are given
first, and in the second column are the tactual. Stimulus 8
is assumed to be of sufficient strength to induce what may be
designated as forced movement, and whatever the quality of
the stimulus this reaction time is constant. I make this statement
theoretically, although all the evidence which this work
furnishes is in support of it. So, likewise, is the variability of
this type of reaction time small and nearly constant. At the
other extreme, stimulus 1 is so weak as to be just sufficient to call
forth a response; it is the so-called threshold stimulus. Whether
all qualities of stimulus will give the same result here is a question
to be settled by experimentation. Wundt contends that
such is the case, but the observations I have made on the electrical
<span class="pagenum">[625]</span><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625"></a>and tactual reactions of the frog cause me to doubt this
assumption. It seems probable that the 'just perceptible stimulus
reaction time' is by no means the same thing for different
qualities of stimulus. Those modifications of the vital processes
which alone enable organisms to survive, make their appearance
even in the response to the minimal stimulus. In one case
the just perceptible stimulus may cause nothing more than slight
local changes in circulation, excretion, muscular action; in another
it may produce, just because of the particular significance
of the stimulus to the life of the organism, a violent and sudden
motor reaction. But grant, if you will, that the threshold
reaction time is the same for all kinds of stimuli, and suppose
that the variability is fairly constant, then, between the two extremes
of stimuli, there are gradations in strength which give
reaction times of widely differing variabilities. If, now, at
some point in the series, as, for instance, to stimulus 2, the
variability for different kinds of stimuli is the same either with
reference to the reaction time (ratio) or absolutely, what interpretation
is to be put upon the fact? Is it to be regarded as
merely a matter of chance, and unworthy of any special attention,
or should it be studied with a view to finding out precisely
what variability itself signifies? It is obvious that any discussion
of this subject, even of the possible or probable value of
variability as a criterion for the comparative study of stimuli, can
be of little value so long as we do not know what are the determining
factors of variations of this sort. The only suggestion
as to the meaning of such a condition (<i>i.e.</i>, equal variability at
some point)&mdash;and our studies seem to show it for touch and
electrical stimulation&mdash;which I feel justified in offering at present,
is that parity in variability indicates equality in strength of
stimuli, that is, the electrical stimulus which has a reaction
time of the same variability as a tactual stimulus has the same
effect upon the peripheral nervous system as the tactual, it produces
the same amplitude and perhaps the same form of wave,
but the reaction times for the two stimuli differ because of the
biological significance of the stimuli. The chances are that
this is wholly dependent upon the central nervous system.<span class="pagenum">[626]</span><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626"></a></p>


<h3>IX. SUMMARY.</h3>


<p>1. This paper gives the results of some experiments on the
frog to determine its electrical and tactual reaction time. It is
the beginning of comparative reaction-time studies by which it
is hoped important information may be gained concerning the
significance and modes of action of the nervous system. Comparative
physiology has already made clear that the time relations
of neural processes deserve careful study.</p>

<p>2. According to the strength of the stimulus, electric stimulation
of the frog causes three types of reaction: (1) A very
weak or threshold stimulus results in a deliberate or delayed reaction,
the time of which may be anywhere from 300&sigma; (thousandths
of a second) to 2,000&sigma;. (2) A very strong stimulus
causes a spinal reflex, whose time is from 50 to 80&sigma;; and (3) a
stimulus of intermediate strength causes a quick instinctive reaction
of from 150 to 170&sigma; in duration.</p>

<p>3. The reaction time for electric stimuli whose relative
values were 1, 2 and 4 were found to be 300.9&sigma;, 231.5&sigma; and
103.1&sigma;.</p>

<p>4. The reaction time of the frog to a tactual stimulus (contact
of a rubber point) is about 200&sigma;.</p>

<p>5. The variability of reaction times of the frog is great, and
increases as the strength of the stimulus decreases.</p>

<p>6. When two kinds of stimuli (<i>e.g.</i>, electrical and tactual)
give reaction times of equal variability, I consider them directly
comparable.</p>

<p>7. According to this criterion of comparability the reaction
time to electric stimulation which is comparable with that to
tactual is 172.1&sigma;; and it is to be compared with 205.7&sigma;. Both
of these have a variability of approximately 34&sigma;. On this basis
one may say that the tactual reaction time is considerably longer
than the electrical.<span class="pagenum">[627]</span><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627"></a></p>


<h3>PART III. AUDITORY REACTIONS OF FROGS.</h3>


<h3>X. HEARING IN THE FROG.</h3>


<h4>A. Influences of Sounds in the Laboratory.</h4>

<p>After determining the simple reaction time of the green frog
to tactual and electrical stimulation, I attempted to do the same
in case of auditory stimuli. In this I was unsuccessful because
of failure to get the animal to give a motor response which
could be recorded. The animal was placed in an experimenting
box with a string attached to one hind leg as in the experiments
described in Part II., and after it had become accustomed to the
situation a sound was made. A wide range of sounds were
tried, but to none except the croak of another frog was a motor
reaction frequently given. Even a loud noise, such as the explosion
of a large pistol cap, caused a visible motor reaction
only in rare cases. In fifty trials with this stimulus I succeeded
in getting three reactions, and since all of them measured between
230 and 240&sigma; it is perhaps worth while to record the result
as indicative of the auditory reaction time. As these were
the only measurements obtained, I have no satisfactory basis for
the comparison of auditory with other reaction times.</p>

<p>The remarkable inhibition of movement shown by the frog
in the presence of strong auditory stimulation, at least what is
for the human being a strong stimulus, led me to inquire concerning
the limits and delicacy of the sense of hearing in frogs.
In the vast quantity of literature on the structure and functions
of the sense organs of the animal I have been able to find only
a few casual remarks concerning hearing.</p>

<p>In approaching the problem of frog audition we may first
examine the structure of the ear for the purpose of ascertaining
what sounds are likely to affect the organ. There is no outer
ear, but the membrana tympani, or ear drum, covered with
skin, appears as a flat disc from 5 to 10 mm. in diameter on the
side of the head just back of the eye and a little below it. In
the middle ear there is but one bone, the columella, forming the
connecting link between the tympanum and the internal ear.<span class="pagenum">[628]</span><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628"></a>
The inner ear, which contains the sense organs, consists of a
membranous bag, the chief parts of which are the utriculus, the
sacculus, the lagena, and the three semicircular canals. The
cavity of this membranous labyrinth is filled with a fluid, the
endolymph; and within the utriculus, sacculus and lagena are
masses of inorganic matter called the otoliths. The auditory
nerve terminates in eight sense organs, which contain hair cells.
There is no cochlea as in the mammalian ear. The assumption
commonly made is that vibrations in the water or air by direct
contact cause the tympanic membrane to vibrate; this in turn
causes a movement of the columella, which is transmitted to the
perilymphatic fluid of the inner ear. The sensory hair cells are
disturbed by the movements of the otoliths in the endolymph,
and thus an impulse is originated in the auditory nerve which
results in a sensation more or less resembling our auditory sensation.
It is quite probable that the frog's sense of hearing is
very different from ours, and that it is affected only by gross
air vibrations. This conclusion the anatomy of the ear supports.</p>

<p>Although there does not seem to be a structural basis for a
delicate sense of hearing, one must examine the physiological
facts at hand before concluding that frogs do not possess a sense
of hearing similar to our own. First, the fact that frogs make
vocal sounds is evidence in favor of the hearing of such sounds
at least, since it is difficult to explain the origin of the ability to
make a sound except through its utility to the species. Granting,
however, that a frog is able to hear the croaks or pain-screams
of its own species, the range of the sense still remains
very small, for although the race of frogs makes a great variety
of sounds, any one species croaks within a narrow range.</p>

<p>Having satisfied myself that motor reactions for reaction-time
measurements could not be gotten to any ordinary sounds
in the laboratory, I tried the effect of the reflex croaking of
another frog of the same species. In attempting to get frogs to
croak regularly, I tested the effect of removing the brain. The
animals are said to croak reflexly after this operation whenever
the back is stroked; but for some reason I have never been successful
in getting the reaction uniformly. In many cases I was
able to make normal animals croak by rubbing the back or
<span class="pagenum">[629]</span><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629"></a>flanks, and to this sound the animals under observation occasionally
responded by taking what looked like an attitude of attention.
They straightened up and raised the head as if listening.
In no case have other motor responses been noticed; and
the above response was so rare that no reaction-time measurements
could be made.</p>

<p>Again, while working with the green frog on habit formation,
I one day placed two animals in a labyrinth from which they
could escape by jumping into a tank of water. Several times
when one frog jumped into the water I noticed the other one
straighten up and hold the 'listening' or 'attentive' attitude for
some seconds. As the animals could not see one another this
is good evidence of their ability to hear the splash made by a
frog when it strikes the water.</p>


<h4>B. Influence of Sounds in Nature.</h4>

<p>In order to learn how far fear and artificial conditions were
causes of the inhibition of response to sounds in the laboratory,
and how far the phenomenon was indicative of the animal's inability
to perceive sounds, I observed frogs in their native haunts.</p>

<p>By approaching a pond quietly, it is easy to get within a few
yards of frogs sitting on the banks. In most cases they will
not jump until they have evidence of being noticed. Repeatedly
I have noted that it is never possible to get near to any frogs
in the same region after one has jumped in. In this we have
additional proof that they hear the splash-sound. To make sure
that sight was not responsible for this on-guard condition in
which one finds the frogs after one of their number has jumped
into the water, I made observations on animals that were hidden
from one another. The results were the same. I therefore conclude
that the splash of a frog jumping into the water is not
only perceived by other frogs in the vicinity, but that it is a
peculiarly significant sound for them, since it is indicative of
danger, and serves to put them 'on watch.'</p>

<p>A great variety of sounds, ranging in pitch from a low tone
in imitation of the bull frog's croak to a shrill whistle, and in
loudness from the fall of a pebble to the report of a pistol, were
tried for the purpose of testing their effects upon the animals in
<span class="pagenum">[630]</span><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630"></a>their natural environment. To no sound have I ever seen a
motor response given. One can approach to within a few feet
of a green frog or bull frog and make all sorts of noises
without causing it to give any signs of uneasiness. Just as
soon, however, as a quick movement is made by the observer
the animal jumps. I have repeatedly crept up very close to frogs,
keeping myself screened from them by bushes or trees, and
made various sounds, but have never succeeded in scaring an
animal into a motor response so long as I was invisible. Apparently
they depend almost entirely upon vision for the avoidance
of dangers. Sounds like the splash of a plunging frog
or the croak or pain-scream of another member of the species
serve as warnings, but the animals do not jump into the water
until they see some sign of an unusual or dangerous object.
On one occasion I was able to walk to a spot where a large
bull frog was sitting by the edge of the water, after the frogs
about it had plunged in. This individual, although it seemed
to be on the alert, let me approach close to it. I then saw that
the eye turned toward me was injured. The animal sat still,
despite the noise I made, simply because it was unable to see
me; as soon as I brought myself within the field of vision of
the functional eye the frog was off like a flash.</p>

<p>Many observers have told me that frogs could hear the
human voice and that slight sounds made by a passer-by would
cause them to stop croaking. In no case, however, have such
observers been able to assert that the animals were unaffected
by visual stimuli at the same time. I have myself many times
noticed the croaking stop as I approached a pond, but could
never be certain that none of the frogs had seen me. It is a
noteworthy fact that when one frog in a pond begins to croak
the others soon join it. Likewise, when one member of such a
chorus is frightened and stops the others become silent. This
indicates that the cessation of croaking is a sign of danger and
is imitated just as is the croaking. There is in this fact conclusive
evidence that the animals hear one another, and the
probability is very great that they hear a wide range of sounds
to which they give no motor reactions, since they do not depend
upon sound for escaping their enemies.<span class="pagenum">[631]</span><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631"></a></p>

<p>The phenomenon of inhibition of movement in response to
sounds which we have good reason to think the frogs hear, and
to which such an animal as a turtle or bird would react by trying
to escape, is thus shown to be common for frogs in nature
as well as in the laboratory. This inhibition is in itself not surprising,
since many animals habitually escape certain of their
enemies by remaining motionless, but it is an interesting phenomenon
for the physiologist. We have to inquire, for instance,
what effects sounds which stimulate the auditory organs and
cause the animal to become alert, watchful, yet make it remain
rigidly motionless, have on the primary organic rhythms of the
organism, such as the heart-beat, respiration, and peristalsis.
It is also directly in the line of our investigation to inquire how
they affect reflex movements, or the reaction time for any other
stimulus&mdash;what happens to the reaction time for an electrical
stimulus, for example, if a loud noise precede or accompany
the electrical stimulus.</p>

<p>For the purpose of determining the range of hearing in the
frog, I was driven to study the influence of sounds upon respiration.
Although the animals did not make any detectable
movement, not even of an eyelid, in response to noises, it seemed
not improbable that if the sounds acted as auditory stimuli at
all, they would in some degree modify the form or rate of the
respiratory movement.</p>


<h4>C. Influence of Sounds on Respiration.<a name="FNanchor_16_170" id="FNanchor_16_170"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_16_170'>16</a></h4>

<p>The method of recording the respiration was the direct
transference of the movement of the throat by means of a
pivoted lever, one end of which rested against the throat, while
the other served as a marker on a revolving drum carrying
smoked paper. The frog was put into a small box, visual
stimuli were, so far as possible, excluded and the lever was
adjusted carefully; a record was then taken for at least half
a minute to determine the normal rate of respiration in the
absence of the stimulus whose effect it was the chief purpose
of the experiment to discover. Then, as soon as everything
was running smoothly, the auditory stimulus was given.<span class="pagenum">[632]</span><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632"></a>
The following records indicate the effects of a few stimuli
upon the rate of breathing:</p>


<p><br />1. Stimulus, 100 V. tuning fork.</p>

<p>Number of respirations for 10 cm. <i>before</i> stimulus 18.0, 17.0;
number of respirations for 10 cm. <i>after</i> stimulus 19.0, 17.3.</p>

<p>The records indicate very little change, and contradict one
another. For the same stimulus the experiment was tried of
taking the normal respiration record for a complete revolution
of the drum, and then at once taking the record for the same
length of time (about two minutes) with the tuning-fork vibrating
close to the frog. The following result is typical and
proves that the sound has little effect.</p>

<p>Number of respirations in a revolution <i>before</i> stimulus:
First rev. 88; second rev. 88. Number of respirations in a
revolution <i>during</i> stimulus: First rev. 87; second rev. 88.</p>

<p>Concerning the influence of tuning-fork stimuli more will
be said later in a consideration of the effects of auditory stimuli
upon reactions to visual stimuli.</p>


<p><br />2. The influence of falling water as an auditory stimulus.
Water was allowed to fall about two feet in imitation, first, of a
plunging frog, and second, of water falling over rocks. In
representing the effect of the stimulus on the rate of respiration,
I have given the distance on the drum covered by the ten complete
respirations just preceding the stimulus and the ten following
it.</p>

</table></div>

<p><i>These records show a marked increase in the rate of respiration
just after the auditory stimulus is given for the first time.</i>
The stimulus has less effect when repeated after an interval of
one or two minutes, and if repeated several times it finally
causes no noticeable change. On the whole, the sound of falling
water seems to arouse the animals to fuller life. The
<span class="pagenum">[633]</span><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633"></a>stimulus appears to interest them, and it certainly accelerates
respiration. This is precisely what one would expect from a
sound which is of special significance in the life of the animal.</p>


<p>3. In case of a loud shrill whistle inhibition of respiration
resulted. This probably means that the frogs were frightened
by the sound. Falling water served rather to excite their
natural-habitat associations, whereas, the whistle, being an uncommon
and unassociated sound, caused fear. It is evident to
the casual observer that the frog sometimes inhibits and sometimes
increases its respiratory movements when frightened, so
the result in this experiment is in no way surprising. I am by
no means certain, however, that a longer series of observations
on several individuals would give constant inhibitory results.
My immediate purpose in the work was to get evidence of hearing;
the respiratory changes were of secondary importance,
although of such great interest that I have planned a more
thorough special study of them for the future.</p>

<p>These results indicate an increase in the respiration rate due
to the visual stimulus.</p>


<p>4. Of the other auditory stimuli used, the pistol-cap explosion
gave very irregular results. For one animal it caused acceleration,
<span class="pagenum">[634]</span><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634"></a>for another inhibition. There is, however, good evidence
that the sounds were heard.</p>


<p>5. The ringing of a bell gave results similer to those for a
whistle, and the sound of a 500 S.V. tuning fork usually caused
a slight increase in the rate of breathing. In these experiments
I therefore have evidence, through their effects upon respiration,
of the frog's ability to hear sounds ranging from 50 V. to at
least 1,000 V.</p>

<p>The croak of the green frog ranges from 100 to 200 V., so
far as I have been able to determine. That of the bull frog is
lower, from 50 to 75; and in the leopard frog the range is from
80 to 125. The latter is very different from the green frog in
its croaking, in that it croaks whenever disturbed, whereas, the
green frog rarely responds in that way to a stimulus.</p>

<p>We are now in a position to say that the failure of frogs to
give motor reactions to strong auditory stimuli is not due to their
inability to be affected by the stimuli, but is a genuine inhibition
phenomenon.</p>


<h3>XI. THE EFFECTS OF AUDITORY STIMULI ON VISUAL
REACTIONS.</h3>


<p>Further experimental evidence of hearing was gotten from
some work done to test the influence of sounds upon motor reactions
to visual stimuli. Frogs, like most other amphibians,
reptiles and fishes, are attracted by any small moving object
and usually attempt to seize it. They never, so far as I have
noticed, feed upon motionless objects, but, on the other hand,
will take almost anything which moves. Apparently the visual
stimulus of movement excites a reflex. A very surprising thing
to those who are unfamiliar with frog habits is the fear which
small frogs have of large ones. Put some green frogs or
small bull frogs into a tank with large bull frogs, and the
little ones will at once show signs of extreme fear; they jump
about in the most excited manner and try hard to escape. The
cause of their fear soon appears, since it is usually only a few
minutes until the little ones are swallowed by their wide-mouthed,
cannibalistic fellows.</p>

<p>It is, moreover, well known that a bit of red flannel fastened
<span class="pagenum">[635]</span><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635"></a>to a hook attracts frogs and is an excellent method of capturing
them. Red seems to be the color which they most readily
notice.</p>

<p>This tendency of the frog to attempt to seize any moving
object I made use of to test the value of sounds. By placing a
frog in a glass aquarium which was surrounded by a screen,
back of which I could work and through a small hole in which
I was able to watch the animal without being noticed by it, and
then moving a bit of red cardboard along one side of the
aquarium, I could get the frog to jump at it repeatedly. In
each attempt to get the moving object, the animal struck its
head forcibly against the glass side of the aquarium. There
was, therefore, reason to think that a few trials would lead to
the inhibition of the reaction. Experiment discovered the fact
that a hungry frog would usually jump at the card as many as
twenty times in rapid succession.</p>

<p>In this reaction to a visual stimulus there appeared good
material for testing audition. I therefore arranged a 500 S.V.
tuning fork over the aquarium and compared the reactions of
animals to the visual stimulus alone, with that to the visual
stimulus when accompanied by an auditory stimulus. The
tuning-fork sound was chosen because it seemed most likely to
be significant to the frog. It is similar to the sounds made by
the insects upon which frogs feed. For this reason one would
expect that the sight of a moving object and the sound of a
tuning-fork would tend to re&euml;nforce one another.</p>

<p>The experiments were begun with observations on the
effects of moving objects on the respiration. In case of a
normal rate of 54 respirations per minute sight of the red object
caused an increase to 58. Then the same determination was
made for the auditory stimulus. The tuning-fork usually
caused an increase in rate. In a typical experiment it was
from 65 per minute to 76. The observations prove conclusively
that the 500 S.V. sound is heard. My attention was
turned to the difference of the environment of the ear in its
relation to hearing. Apparently frogs hear better when the
tympanum is partially under water than when it is fully exposed
to the air.<span class="pagenum">[636]</span><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636"></a></p>

<p>Having discovered by repeated trials about how vigorously
and frequently a frog would react to the moving red card, I
tried the effect of setting the fork in vibration a half minute before
showing the card. It was at once evident that the sound
put the frog on the alert, and, when the object came into view,
it jumped at it more quickly and a greater number of times than
when the visual stimulus was given without the auditory. This
statement is based on the study of only two animals, since I was
unable to get any other frogs that were in the laboratory at the
time to take notice of the red cardboard. This was probably
because of the season being winter. I venture to report the results
simply because they were so definite as to point clearly to
the phenomenon of the re&euml;nforcement of the visual-stimulus
reaction by an auditory stimulus.</p>

<p>Concerning the influence of this combining of stimuli on the
reaction time, I am only able to say that the reaction to the
moving object occurred quicker in the presence of the auditory
stimulus. When the red card was shown it was often several
seconds before the frog would notice it and attempt to get it,
but when the sound also was given the animal usually noticed
and jumped toward the moving card almost immediately.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I have thus far been unable to get chronoscopic
measurements of the reaction times in this re&euml;nforcement
phenomenon. I hope later to be able to follow out the interesting
suggestions of these few experiments in the study of re&euml;nforcement
and inhibition as caused by simultaneously given
stimuli.</p>

<p>A few observations made in connection with these experiments
are of general interest. The frog, when it first sees a
moving object, usually draws the nictitating membrane over the
eye two or three times as if to clear the surface for clearer
vision. Frequently this action is the only evidence available
that the animal has noticed an object. This movement of the
eye-lids I have noticed in other amphibians and in reptiles under
similar conditions, and since it always occurs when the animals
have need of the clearest possible vision, I think the above interpretation
of the action is probably correct.</p>

<p>Secondly, the frog after getting a glimpse of an object orients
<span class="pagenum">[637]</span><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637"></a>itself by turning its head towards the object, and then waits
for a favorable chance to spring. The aiming is accurate, and
as previously stated the animal is persistent in its attempts to
seize an object.</p>


<h3>XII. THE PAIN-SCREAM OF FROGS.</h3>


<p>While making measurements of the frog's reaction time to electrical
stimulation, I noticed that after a few repetitions of a 2-volt,
.0001-amp&egrave;re stimulus an animal would frequently make a very
peculiar noise. The sound is a prolonged scream, like that of
a child, made by opening the mouth widely. The ordinary croak
and grunt are made with closed or but slightly opened mouth.
The cry at once reminds one of the sounds made by many animals
when they are frightened. The rabbit, for example,
screams in much the same way when it is caught, as do also
pigs, dogs, rats, mice and many other animals. The question
arises, is this scream indicative of pain? While studying reaction
time I was able to make some observations on the relation
of the scream to the stimulus.</p>

<p>First, the scream is not given to weak stimuli, even upon
many repetitions. Second, it is given to such strengths of an
electrical stimulus as are undoubtedly harmful to the animal.
Third, after a frog has been stimulated with a strong current
(two volts), until the scream is given with almost every repetition,
it will scream in the same way when even a weak stimulus is
applied. If, for instance, after a two-volt stimulus has been given
a few times, the animal be merely touched with a stick, it will
scream. It thus appears as if the strong stimulus increases the
irritability of the center for the scream-reflex to such an extent
that even weak stimuli are sufficient to cause the reaction. Are
we to say that the weak stimulus is painful because of the increased
irritability, or may it be concluded that the reflex is in this
case, like winking or leg-jerk or the head-lowering and puffing,
simply a forced movement, which is to be explained as an
hereditary protective action, but not as necessarily indicative of
any sort of feeling. Clearly if we take this stand it may at once
be said that there is no reason to believe the scream indicative
of pain at any time. And it seems not improbable that this is
<span class="pagenum">[638]</span><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638"></a>nearer the truth than one who hears the scream for the first
time is likely to think.</p>

<p>The pain-scream is of interest in this consideration of auditory
reactions because it increases the range of sounds which
we should expect frogs to hear if we grant the probability of
them hearing their own voices.</p>

<p>It may be worth while to recall at this point the fact that a
whistle from the human lips&mdash;the nearest approach to the pain-scream
among the sounds which were used as stimuli in the
experiments on respiration&mdash;caused marked inhibition of respiration.
Perhaps this fact may be interpreted in the light of the
pain-scream reaction. I may add that I have never seen a frog
give a motor reaction to the pain-scream. Thinking it would
certainly alarm the animals and cause them to make some
movement which would serve for reaction-time measurements,
I made repeated trials of its effects, but could never detect anything
except respiratory changes.</p>

<h2><a name="PSY1" id="PSY1"></a>THE POSITION OF PSYCHOLOGY IN THE
SYSTEM OF KNOWLEDGE.</h2>

<h4>BY HUGO M&Uuml;NSTERBERG.</h4>



<p><span class="pagenum">[641]</span><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641"></a>The modern efforts to bring all sciences into a system or at
least to classify them, from Bacon to Spencer, Wundt and Pearson
have never, if we abstract here from Hegel, given much attention
to those questions of principle which are offered by the
science of psychology. Of course the psychological separation
of different mental functions has often given the whole scheme
for the system, the classification thus being too often more psychological
than logical. Psychology itself, moreover, has had
for the most part a dignified position in the system; even when
it has been fully subordinated to the biological sciences, it was
on the other hand placed superior to the totality of mental and
moral sciences, which then usually have found their unity under
the positivistic heading 'sociology.' And where the independent
position of psychology is acknowledged and the mental
and moral sciences are fully accredited, as for instance with
Wundt, psychology remains the fundamental science of all
mental sciences; the objects with which philology, history,
economics, politics, jurisprudence, theology deal are the products
of the processes with which psychology deals, and philology,
history, theology, etc., are thus related to psychology,
as astronomy, geology, zo&ouml;logy are related to physics. There
is thus nowhere a depreciation of psychology, and yet it is
not in its right place. Such a position for psychology at the
head of all 'Geisteswissenschaften' may furnish a very simple
classification for it, but it is one which cannot express the
difficult character of psychology and the complex relations
of the system of mental sciences. The historical and philological
and theological sciences cannot be subordinated to
psychology if psychology as science is to be co&ouml;rdinated with
<span class="pagenum">[642]</span><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642"></a>physics, that is, if it is a science which describes and explains
the psychical objects in the way in which physics describes
and explains the physical objects. On the other hand,
if it means in this central position of mental sciences a science
which does not consider the inner life as an object, but as subjective
activity needing to be interpreted and subjectively understood,
not as to its elements, but as to its meaning, then we
should have two kinds of psychology, one which explains and
one which interprets. They would speak of different facts, the
one of the inner life as objective content of consciousness, as
phenomenon, the other of the inner life as subjective attitude,
as purpose.</p>

<p>The fact is, that these two sciences exist to-day. There are
psychologists who recognize both and keep them separated,
others who hold to the one or the other as the only possible
view; they are phenomenalists or voluntarists. Mostly both
views are combined, either as psychological voluntarism with
interposed concessions to phenomenalism or as phenomenalism
with the well-known concessions to voluntarism at the deciding
points. Further, those who claim that psychology must
be phenomenalistic&mdash;and that is the opinion of the present
writer&mdash;do not on that account hold that the propositions of
voluntarism are wrong. On the contrary: voluntarism, we say, is
right in every respect except in believing itself to be psychology.
Voluntarism, we say, is the interpretative account of the real
life, of immediate experience, whose reality is understood by
understanding its meaning sympathetically, but we add that in
this way an objective description can never be reached. Description
presupposes objectivation; another aspect, not the natural
aspect of life, must be chosen to fulfill the logical purposes
of psychology: the voluntaristic inner life must be considered
as content of consciousness while consciousness is then no longer
an active subject but a passive spectator. Experience has then
no longer any meaning in a voluntaristic sense; it is merely a
complex of elements. We claim that every voluntaristic system
as far as it offers descriptions and explanations has borrowed them
from phenomenalistic psychology and is further filled up by fragments
of logic, ethics and &aelig;sthetics, all of which refer to man in
<span class="pagenum">[643]</span><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643"></a>his voluntaristic aspect. We claim, therefore, that such a voluntaristic
theory has no right to the name psychology, while we
insist that it gives a more direct account of man's real life than
psychology can hope to give, and, moreover, that it is the voluntaristic
man whose purpose creates knowledge and thus creates
the phenomenalistic aspect of man himself.</p>

<p>We say that the voluntaristic theory, the interpretation of
our real attitudes, in short teleological knowledge, alone can
account for the value and right of phenomenalistic psychology
and it thus seems unfair to raise the objection of 'double bookkeeping.'
These two aspects of inner life are not ultimately
independent and exclusive; the subjective purposes of real
life necessarily demand the labors of objectivistic psychology.
The last word is thus not dualistic but monistic and the two truths
supplement each other. But this supplementation must never
be misinterpreted as meaning that the two sciences divide inner
experience, as if, for instance, the phenomenalistic study dealt
with perceptions and ideas, the voluntaristic with feelings and
volitions. No, it is really a difference of logical purpose of
treatment and thus a difference of points of view only; the
whole experience without exception must be possible material
for both. There is no feeling and no volition which is not for
the phenomenalist a content of consciousness and nothing else.
There is, on the other hand, no perception and no idea which is
not, or better, ought not to be for the voluntarist a means, an
aim, a tool, an end, an ideal. In that real life experience of
which the voluntarist is speaking, every object is the object of
will and those real objects have not been differentiated into
physical things under the abstract categories of mechanics on
the one hand, and psychical ideas of them in consciousness on
the other; the voluntarist, if he is consistent, knows neither
physical nor psychical phenomena. Phenomenalist and voluntarist
thus do not see anything under the same aspect, neither
the ideas nor the will.</p>

<p>This difference is wrongly set forth if the antithesis to voluntarism
is called intellectualism. Intellectualism is based on the
category of judgment, and judgment too is a ideological attitude.
Phenomenalism does not presuppose a subject which<span class="pagenum">[644]</span><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644"></a>
knows its contents but a subject which simply <i>has</i> its contents;
the consciousness which has the thought as content does not
take through that the voluntaristic attitude of knowing it and
the psychologist has therefore no reason to prefer the thought
to the volition and thus to play the intellectualist. If the psychologist
does emphasize the idea and its elements, the sensations,
it is not because they are vehicles of thought but because
their relations to physical objects make them vehicles of communication.
The elements of ideas are negotiable and thus
through their reference to the common physical world indirectly
describable; as the elements of ideas are alone in this position,
the psychologist is obliged to consider all contents of consciousness,
ideas and volitions alike, as complexes of sensations.</p>

<p>The antithesis is also misinterpreted, or at least wrongly narrowed,
if it is called voluntarism <i>versus</i> associationism. Recent
discussions have sufficiently shown that the principle of association
is not the only possible one for phenomenalistic theories.
If associationism is identified with objective psychology, all the
well-founded objections to the monopoly of the somewhat sterile
principle of association appear as objections to phenomenalism
in psychology, and voluntaristic theories, especially those which
work with the teleological category of apperception, are put in
its place. But without returning to apperceptionism we can
overcome the one-sidedness of associationism if full use is
made of the means which the world of phenomena offers to
theory. The insufficiency of associationism disappears if the
content of consciousness is considered as variable not only as
to quality and intensity but also as to vividness. This variation
of vividness, on the other hand, is no exception from the psychophysical
parallelism as soon as the psychical process is considered
as dependent not only upon the local and quantitative
differences of the sensory process but also upon the motor
function of the central physical process. The one-sidedness
of the physiological sensory theories has been the hidden reason
for the one-sidedness of associationism. The sensory-motor
system must be understood as the physical basis of the psychophysical
process and the variations in the motor discharge
then become conditions of those psychical variations of vividness
<span class="pagenum">[645]</span><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645"></a>which explain objectively all those phenomena in whose
interest associationism is usually supplemented by apperceptionism.
The association theory must thus be given up in favor
of an 'action-theory'<a name="FNanchor_1_172" id="FNanchor_1_172"></a><a class='fnanchor' href='#Footnote_1_171'>1</a> which combines the consistency of phenomenalistic
explanation with a full acknowledgment of the so-called
apperceptive processes; it avoids thus the deficiency of
associationism and the logical inconsistency of apperceptionism.</p>

<p>Only if in this way the sciences of voluntaristic type, including
all historical and normative sciences, are fully separated
from phenomenalistic psychology, will there appear on the psychological
side room for a scientific treatment of the phenomena
of social life, that is, for sociology, social psychology, folk-psychology,
psychical anthropology and many similar sciences.
All of them have been in the usual system either crowded out by
the fact that history and the other mental sciences have taken all
the room or have been simply identified with the mental sciences
themselves. And yet all those sciences exist, and a real system
of sciences must do justice to all of them. A modern classification
has perhaps no longer the right as in Bacon's time to improve
the system by inventing new sciences which have as yet no
existence, but it has certainly the duty not to ignore important
departments of knowledge and not to throw together different
sciences like the descriptive phenomenalistic account of inner
life and its interpretative voluntaristic account merely because
each sometimes calls itself psychology. A classification of
sciences which is to be more than a catalogue fulfills its logical
function only by a careful disentanglement of logically different
functions which are externally connected. Psychology and the
totality of psychological, philosophical and historical sciences
offer in that respect far more difficulty than the physical
sciences, which have absorbed up to this time the chief interest
of the classifier. It is time to follow up the ramifications of
knowledge with special interest for these neglected problems.
It is clear that in such a system sciences which refer to the same
objects may be widely separated, and sciences whose objects are
unlike may be grouped together. This is not an objection; it
<span class="pagenum">[646]</span><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646"></a>indicates that a system is more than a mere pigeon-holing of
scholarly work, that it determines the logical relations; in this
way only can it indeed become helpful to the progress of science
itself.</p>

<p>The most direct way to our end is clearly that of graphic
representation wherein the relations are at once apparent. Of
course such a map is a symbol and not an argument; it indicates
the results of thought without any effort to justify them.
I have given my arguments for the fundamental principles of
the divisions in my 'Grundz&uuml;ge der Psychologie' and have
repeated a few points more popularly in 'Psychology and
Life,' especially in the chapter on 'Psychology and History.'
And yet this graphic appendix to the Grundz&uuml;ge may not be
superfluous, as the fulness of a bulky volume cannot bring out
clearly enough the fundamental relations; the detail hides the
principles. The parallelism of logical movements in the different
fields especially becomes more obvious in the graphic form.
Above all, the book discussed merely those groups which had
direct relation to psychology; a systematic classification must
leave no remainder. Of course here too I have not covered the
whole field of human sciences, as the more detailed ramification
offers for our purpose no logical interest; to subdivide
physics or chemistry, the history of nations or of languages,
practical jurisprudence or theology, engineering or surgery,
would be a useless overburdening of the diagram without throwing
new light on the internal relations of knowledge.</p>

<p>Without now entering more fully into any arguments, I may
indicate in a few words the characteristic features of the graphically
presented proposition. At the very outset we must make
it clear that phenomena and voluntaristic attitudes are not co&ouml;rdinated,
but that the reality of phenomena is logically dependent
upon voluntaristic attitudes directed towards the ideal of
knowledge. And yet it would be misleading to place the totality
of phenomenalistic sciences as a subdivision under the
teleological sciences. Possible it would be; we might have
under the sciences of logical attitudes not only logic and mathematics
but as a subdivision of these, again, the sciences which
construct the logical system of a phenomenalistic world&mdash;physics
<span class="pagenum">[647]</span><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647"></a>being in this sense merely mathematics with the conception of
substance added. And yet we must not forget that the teleological
attitudes, to become a teleological science, must be also
logically reconstructed, as they must be teleologically connected,
and thus in this way the totality of purpose-sciences
might be, too, logically subordinated to the science of logic.
Logic itself would thus become a subdivision of logic. We
should thus move in a circle, from which the only way out is to
indicate the teleological character of all sciences by starting
not with science but with the strictly teleological conception of
life&mdash;life as a system of purposes, felt in immediate experience,
and not as the object of phenomenalistic knowledge.
Life as activity divides itself then into different purposes which
we discriminate not by knowledge but by immediate feeling;
one of them is knowledge, that is, the effort to make life, its
attitudes, its means and ends a connected system of overindividual
value. In the service of this logical task we connect
the real attitudes and thus come to the knowledge of purposes:
and we connect the means and ends&mdash;by abstracting from our
subjective attitudes, considering the objects of will as independent
phenomena&mdash;and thus come to phenomenalistic knowledge.
At this stage the phenomenalistic sciences are no longer
dependent upon the teleological ones, but co&ouml;rdinated with
them; physics, for instance, is a logical purpose of life, but not
a branch of logic: the only branch of logic in question is the
philosophy of physics which examines the logical conditions
under which physics is possible.</p>

<p>One point only may at once be mentioned in this connection.
While we have co&ouml;rdinated the knowledge of phenomena with the
knowledge of purposes we have subordinated mathematics to the
latter. As a matter of course much can be said against such a
decision, and the authority of most mathematicians would be
opposed to it. They would say that the mathematical objects
are independent realities whose properties we study like those
of nature, whose relations we 'observe,' whose existence we
'discover' and in which we are interested because they belong
to the real world. All that is true, and yet the objects of the
mathematician are objects made by the will, by the logical will,
<span class="pagenum">[648]</span><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648"></a>only, and thus different from all phenomena into which sensation
enters. The mathematician, of course, does not reflect on
the purely logical origin of the objects which he studies, but the
system of knowledge must give to the study of the mathematical
objects its place in the group where the functions and products of
logical thought are classified. The arithmetical or geometrical
material is a free creation, and a creation not only as to the
combination of elements&mdash;that would be the case with many
laboratory substances of the chemist too&mdash;but a creation as to
the elements themselves, and the value of the creation, its
'mathematical interest,' is to be judged by ideals of thought,
that is, by logical purposes. No doubt this logical purpose is
its application in the world of phenomena, and the mathematical
concept must thus fit the world so absolutely that it can be conceived
as a description of the world after abstracting not only
from the will relations, as physics does, but also from the content.
Mathematics would then be the phenomenalistic science
of the form and order of the world. In this way mathematics
has a claim to places in both fields: among the phenomenalistic
sciences if we emphasize its applicability to the world, and
among the teleological sciences if we emphasize the free creation
of its objects by the logical will. It seems to me that a
logical system as such has to prefer the latter emphasis; we
thus group mathematics beside logic and the theory of knowledge
as a science of objects freely created for purposes of
thought.</p>

<p>All logical knowledge is divided into Theoretical and Practical.
The modern classifications have mostly excluded the
practical sciences from the system, rightly insisting that no
facts are known in the practical sciences which are not in principle
covered by the theoretical sciences; it is art which is
superadded, but not a new kind of knowledge. This is quite
true so far as a classification of objects of knowledge is in question,
but as soon as logical tasks as such are to be classified and
different aspects count as different sciences, then it becomes
desirable to discriminate between the sciences which take the
attitude of theoretical interest and those which consider the
same facts as related to certain human ends. But we may at
<span class="pagenum">[649]</span><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649"></a>first consider the theoretical sciences only. They deal either
with the objectified world, with objects of consciousness which
are describable and explainable, or with the subjectivistic world
of real life in which all reality is experienced as will and as
object of will, in which everything is to be understood by interpretation
of its meaning. In other words, we deal in one case
with phenomena and in the other with purposes.</p>

<p>The further subdivision must be the same for both groups&mdash;that
which is merely individual and that which is 'overindividual';
we prefer the latter term to the word 'general,' to
indicate at once that not a numerical but a teleological difference
is in question. A phenomenon is given to overindividual consciousness
if it is experienced with the understanding that it can
be an object for every one whom we acknowledge as subject;
and a purpose is given to overindividual will in so far as it is
conceived as ultimately belonging to every subject which we
acknowledge. The overindividual phenomena are, of course,
the physical objects, the individual phenomena the psychical
objects, the overindividual purposes are the norms, the individual
purposes are the acts which constitute the historical
world. We have thus four fundamental groups: the physical,
the psychological, the normative and the historical sciences.</p>

<p>Whoever denies overindividual reality finds himself in the
world of phenomena a solipsist and in the world of purposes
a sceptic: there is no objective physical world, everything is
my idea, and there is no objective value, no truth, no morality,
everything is my individual decision. But to deny truth and
morality means to contradict the very denial, because the denial
itself as judgment demands acknowledgment of this objective
truth and as action demands acknowledgment of the moral duty
to speak the truth. And if an overindividual purpose cannot
be denied, it follows that there is a community of individual
subjects whose phenomena cannot be absolutely different:
there must be an objective world of overindividual objects.</p>

<p>In each of the four groups of sciences we must consider the
facts either with regard to the general relations or with regard
to the special material; the abstract general relations refer to
every possible material, the concrete facts which fall under
<span class="pagenum">[650]</span><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650"></a>them demand sciences of their own. In the world of phenomena
the general relations are causal laws&mdash;physical or psychical
laws; in the world of purposes theories of teleological interrelations&mdash;normative
or historical; the specific concrete facts are
in the world of phenomena objects, physical or psychical
objects, in the world of purposes acts of will&mdash;specific norms
or historical acts. If we turn first to phenomena, the laws
thereof are expressed in the physical sciences, by mechanics,
physics, chemistry, and we make mechanics the superior as
chemistry must become ultimately the mechanics of atoms. In
the psychological sciences the science of laws is psychology,
with the side-branch of animal psychology, while human
psychology refers to individuals and to social groups. Social
psychology, as over against individual psychology, is thus a
science of general laws, the laws of those psychological
phenomena which result from the mutual influence of several
individuals.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have as the special concrete products
of the laws, the objects themselves, and the most natural grouping
of them may be from whole to part. In the physical world
it means that we start from the concrete universe, turning then
to the earth, then to the objects on the earth, inorganic and
organic. There is here no logical difficulty. Each one of these
objects can be considered in three aspects, firstly as to its structure,
secondly as to its special laws, that is, the special function
of the object as related to the general sciences of physics and
chemistry, and thirdly as to its natural development. If we
apply these three methods of study to the whole universe we
have astronomy, astrophysics and cosmology, to the whole earth,
geography, geophysics, geology, to animals, zo&ouml;logy, physiology,
comparative anatomy, and so on.</p>

<p>The special phenomena in the framework of the psychological
sciences group themselves in the same logical order, from
the whole to the part. The psychological totality is empirical
mankind, and as we select the earth as the one part of the universe
which is the habitat of man, so our scientific interest must
move from the whole psychical humanity to those phenomena of
human life which are the vehicle of our civilization, from mankind
<span class="pagenum">[651]</span><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651"></a>to its most important function, the association of man; and as we
moved from earth to the special objects on earth, so we may
turn from association to the special phenomena which result
from association. If we separated further the inorganic from the
organic, we must here separate the products of undifferentiated
and of differentiated association. The science of mankind is
race psychology, the science of the association of man is sociology,
the science of the results of undifferentiated association
is V&ouml;lkerpsychologie, folk psychology. The science of products
of differentiated association has no special name; its subject
matter is the whole of historical civilization considered as a
psychological naturalistic phenomenon. As soon as we follow
the ramification still further we have to do with the special kinds
of these products, that is, with the volitions, thoughts, appreciations
and beliefs. In the undifferentiated associations they give
us morals and habits, languages and enjoyments and mythological
ideas, while the individually differentiated association gives
political, legal and economic life, knowledge, art and religion:
all of course merely as causal, not as teleological processes, and
thus merely as psychological and not as historical material.
Here, as with the physical phenomena, the structure, the special
laws and the development must be everywhere separated, giving
us three sciences in every case. For instance, the study of mankind
deals with the differences of mental structure in psychical
anthropology, with the special psychical laws in race psychology
and with the development in comparative psychology. The
chief point for us is that social psychology, race psychology,
sociology, folk psychology, etc., are under this system sharply
differentiated sciences and that they do not at all overlap the
real historical sciences. There is no historical product of
civilization which does not come under their method but it must
be conceived as a causal phenomenon, not as related to the purposes
of the real man, and thus even the development means
merely a growing complication of naturalistic processes and not
history in the teleological sense.</p>

<p>We turn to the normative sciences. The general theory of
the overindividual purposes is metaphysics; the special overindividual
acts are those which constitute the normative volitions,
<span class="pagenum">[652]</span><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652"></a>connected in the philosophy of morals, the philosophy of state
and the philosophy of law, those which constitute the normative
thoughts and finally those which constitute the normative appreciations
and beliefs, connected in &aelig;sthetics and the philosophy
of religion. Especial interest belongs to the philosophy
of thought. We have discussed the reasons why we group
mathematics here and not among the phenomenalistic sciences.
We have thus one science which deals critically with the presuppositions
of thought, <i>i.e.</i> the theory of knowledge or epistemology,
which can be divided into the philosophy of physical
sciences, the philosophy of psychological sciences, the philosophy
of normative sciences and the philosophy of historical
sciences. We have secondly the science of the processes of
thought dealing with concepts, judgments and reasoning, <i>i.e.</i>,
logic, and we have finally the science of those objects which the
thought creates freely for its own purposes and which are independent
from the content of the world, <i>i.e.</i>, mathematics, which
leads to the qualitative aspect of general mathematics and the
quantitative aspect of concrete mathematics. For our purposes
it may be sufficient to separate externally algebra, arithmetic,
analysis and geometry. In this way all the philosophical sciences
find their natural and necessary place in the system, while it has
been their usual lot to form an appendix to the system, incommensurable
with the parts of the system itself, even in the case
that the other scheme were not preferred, to make ethics, logic,
&aelig;sthetics, epistemology and metaphysics merely special branches
of positivistic sociology and thus ultimately of biology.</p>

<p>In the historical sciences the general theory which stands
over against the special acts has a special claim on our attention.
We may call it the philosophy of history. That is not
identical with the philosophy of historical sciences which we
mentioned as a part of epistemology. The philosophy of historical
sciences deals with the presuppositions by which historical
teleological knowledge becomes logically possible. The
philosophy of history seeks a theory which connects the special
historical acts into a unity. It has two branches. It is either
a theory of the personality, creating a theory of real individual
life as it enters as ideological factor into history, or it seeks the
<span class="pagenum">[653]</span><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653"></a>unity of entire humanity. The theory of personality shows the
teleological interrelation of our purposes; the theory of humanity
shows the teleological interrelation of all nations. The name
philosophy of history has been used mostly for the theory of
humanity only, abstracting from the fact that it has been often
misused for sociology or for the psychology of history or for
the philosophy of historical sciences&mdash;but the name belongs
also to the theory of personality. This theory of personality
is exactly that second kind of 'psychology' which does not
describe and does not explain but which interprets the inner
teleological connections of the real man. It is 'voluntaristic
psychology' or, as others call it who see correctly the relation
of this science to history, 'historical psychology.' It is practically
'apperceptionistic psychology.' The special activities
of the historical man divide themselves again into volitions,
thoughts, appreciations and beliefs, with their realization in the
state, law, economical systems, knowledge, art and religion.
Each of these special realizations must allow the same manifoldness
in treatment which we found with the special physical
or psychical objects; we can ask as to structure, relation to
the general view and development. But in accordance with the
teleological material the study of the structure here means
'interpretation,' the study of the general relations here means
study of the relation to civilization, and the study of the development
here means the real history. We have, thus, for the state
or law or economy or knowledge or art or religion always one
science which interprets the historical systems of state, etc., in
a systematic and philological way, one science which deals
with its function in the historical world and one which studies
biographically and nationally the history of state, law, economical
life, science, art or religion.</p>

<p>In the sphere of the practical sciences the divisions of the
theoretical sciences must repeat themselves. We have thus applied
physical, applied psychological, applied normative and
applied historical sciences, and it is again the antithesis of psychological
and of historical sciences which is of utmost importance
and yet too often neglected. The application of physical
sciences, as in engineering, medicine, etc., or the application of
<span class="pagenum">[654]</span><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654"></a>normative knowledge in the sciences of criticism do not offer
logical difficulty, but the application of psychological and historical
knowledge does. Let us take the case of pedagogy or
of penology, merely as illustrations. Is the application of phenomenalistic
psychology or the application of teleological voluntarism
in question? Considering the child, the criminal, any
man, as psychophysical apparatus which must be objectively
changed and treated, we have applied psychology; considering
him as subject with purposes, as bearer of an historical civilization
whose personalities must be interpreted and understood and
appreciated, then we need applied historical knowledge. In
the first case the science of pedagogy is a psycho-technical discipline
which makes education mechanical and deprives the
teacher of the teleological attitude of inner understanding; in
the second case it is a science of real education far removed
from psychology. All the sciences which deal with service in
the system of civilization, service as teacher, as judge, as social
helper, as artist, as minister, are sciences which apply the teleological
historical knowledge, and their meaning is lost if they
are considered as psycho-technical sciences only.<span class="pagenum">[655]</span><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655"></a></p>

<p>NOTE: The letters <i>a, b, c</i> below the sciences of Special Objects and Special Acts indicate the three subdivisions that results from the threefold aspects;&mdash;of structure(<i>a</i>), of relation to the
general laws or theories(<i>b</i>), and of development(<i>c</i>). With regards to physical phenomena, for instances, we have astronomy(<i>a</i>), astrophysics(<i>b</i>), and cosmology(<i>c</i>); or geography(<i>a</i>), geophysics(<i>b</i>),
geology(<i>c</i>); or botany(<i>a</i>), plant physiology(<i>b</i>), phylogenetic developemnt of plants(<i>c</i>). In the same way for psychical objects; for instance: structural sociology(<i>a</i>), functional
sociology(<i>b</i>), comparative sociology(<i>c</i>); or structure(grammar and syntax) of languages(<i>a</i>), psychology of languages(<i>b</i>), comparative study of languages(<i>c</i>). With regard to the
telelogical historical sciences the study of structure takes on here the character of intepretation; the relation to the general view is here the dependence on civilization and the development
is here the real history. We have thus, for instance, the intepretation of Roman law(<i>a</i>), dependence of Roman law upon civilization(<i>b</i>), history of Roman law(<i>c</i>).</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
